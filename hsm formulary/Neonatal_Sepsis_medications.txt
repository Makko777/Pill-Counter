Section 6         NEONATOLOGYTable 2: Suggested Guideline for Incubator Humidity for Preterm Infants
Infant selection and thresholds for treatment should be individualized and tailored to local unit practices. Infants ≤ 27 weeks’ gestation 28- < 30weeks’ gestation
Admission Commence humidity of at least 
80%.Commence humidity at 70-80%
Week One Wean gradually to 70-80% If temperature and fluid balance stable after 
72 hours, begin weaning by 5% each day
Week Two If temperature and fluid 
balance stable on day 8, begin 
weaning by 5% each dayDiscontinue when 40% is achieved
Week Three -Four Discontinue incubator humidity 
when 40% is achieved 
Note: the duration and percentage of humidity may vary and depends on the infant’s gestational age, 
serum sodium levels, fluid balance and skin condition. Weaning humidity should only continue when 
clinically indicated as appropriate
After successful staged reductions, the infant’s skin should have keratinised fully at the end of this period
Immediate Care for Symptomatic infants 
Guidelines for the Use of Surfactant • Obtain Venous access (via UVC/PICC or peripheral vein) and Arterial access (via UAC or peripheral 
arterial line)
• Investigations are necessary as indicated and include:      
• Blood gases.    
• Blood glucose 
• Full blood count with differential WBC and IT ratio (if available)     
• Blood culture.      
• Chest X-ray (if respiratory signs and symptoms are present) 
• Start on 10% dextrose drip or Parenteral Nutrition as soon as possible (refer to PN chapter)• Maintain SpO₂ target between 90-95% in the VLBWs 
• Weight, head circumference (OFC), length measurements should be done on admission. Assess the 
gestational age with New Ballard score when stable 
• Monitor vital signs 
A. Clinical indications 
Surfactant replacement therapy should be considered in the following:
• Preterm infants with clinical and radiographic evidence of RDS or on respiratory support with 
oxygen requirement > 0.3-0.4 to maintain SpO 2 target.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYB. Timing of therapy
• Prophylactic surfactant is no longer recommended
• For infants with worsening RDS, early rescue surfactant (within the first 2 hours of age) should be 
provided.
• Intubated preterm infants with RDS who are to be transported to a different neonatal unit should 
be given a dose a surfactant prior to transfer
C. Repeat Doses
• A repeat dose can be given 6 hours after the first dose if there is evidence of ongoing moderate to 
severe RDS and persistent oxygen requirements, FiO 2 > 0.3-0.4
D. Methods of administration 
• Endotracheal administration after intubation
• Intubation, surfactant administration and Extubation (INSURE) 
• Surfactant administration via a thin catheter 
 ͳLess invasive surfactant administration (LISA) method – a small catheter (usually a feeding tube) 
is placed in the trachea with a Magill forceps under direct laryngoscopy.
 ͳMinimally Invasive Surfactant Technique (MIST) method – a more rigid adult vascular catheter 
(e.g., angiocath 16G, length 13cm) is placed in the trachea (hence avoiding the use of Magill 
forceps
E. Potential complications and management  
• During administration, transient bradycardia, oxygen desaturation and ETT blockage can occur – 
temporarily stop surfactant administration, provide ventilation or oxygen as necessary, and resume 
administration after patient is stable.
• ETT obstruction – if suspected, observe saturations and chest wall movement. Re-intubate if 
obstruction is not alleviated and ventilation is impaired. 
• Pneumothorax – can occur due to sudden changes in pulmonary compliance if ventilation settings 
are not appropriately changed.
• Pulmonary hemorrhage – ensure adequate PEEP
F. Special considerations  
• Storage and handling: Surfactant is stored in a refrigerator at +2 to +80C. Surfactant should be slowly 
warmed to room temperature before administration. Gently turn vial upside-down to obtain a 
uniform suspension. DO NOT SHAKE. 
• Unopened, unused vials of surfactant that have been warmed to room temperature can be 
returned to the refrigerator within 24 hours for future use
Assess the need to start antibiotics (refer to Neonatal Sepsis chapter for preterm 
infants ≥35 weeks)
 Apnoea of prematurity ÊFor those infants< 35 weeks’ gestation consider clinical condition of the infant and risk benefit balance
 ÊCommon in infants born < 34 weeks’ gestation. 
 ÊConsider starting caffeine or aminophylline in those less than 32 weeks or with apnoea of prematurity

Discharge planningSupplements: 
Developmental Care
Discharge CriteriaScreening  ÊHep B vaccine:  Refer to  Management of Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) transmission chapter
 ÊBCG vaccine is given on discharge. 
 ÊRoutine immunisation should generally follow the schedule according to chronological age regardless of 
birth weight and gestational age (except for Hepatitis B vaccine) rather than corrected age
 ÊDefer immunisation in the presence of acute illnesses. 
1. To primary health care for follow up and immunization should be as per the Malaysian immunization 
schedule.
2. Palivizumab (RSV immunoglobulin) is advised for high-risk infant to prevent severe RSV disease 
whenever possible.
3. Monitor for metabolic bone disease of prematurity and to treat accordingly.
4. Late preterm infants with no associated complications can be followed up in the health clinics
5. High -risk preterm infants need to be followed up   for growth and neurodevelopmental outcome
6. Parental education including basic life support. (BLS)• At birth: intramuscular (IM) Vitamin K (0.5 mg for BW<1.5 kg; 1 mg for BW ≥ 1.5 kg) to prevent 
haemorrhagic disease of newborn.
• Refer to Enteral Feeding in the Neonates Chapter for other supplements.
• Developmental care and Kangaroo care should be encouraged as evidence have shown better growth 
and neurodevelopmental outcome as well as to increase bonding with the parents. 
• This can be done when the infant is stable
The infants are discharged once they are well, showing good weight gain, established oral feeding and 
gestational age of at least 35 weeks.• Cranial Ultrasound. Suggested recommendation for screening for preterm infants ≤ 32 weeks:  
 ÊFirst screening: Within first week of life 
 ÊSecond screening: 10-14 days of life
 ÊThird screening: 28 -30 days of life 
 ÊSubsequent screening: Around 36 weeks or at discharge or monthly or more often if clinically 
indicated

Enteral Feeding in Preterm and High-risk Infants
Introduction
Mother’s Own Milk (MOM)
Donor Human MilkTypes of milk for Newborn feeding
Human Milk Fortifier (HMF)• The goal of enteral nutrition is to meet nutrient needs and to achieve as near to normal weight gain and 
growth as possible. 
• Enteral feeding should be introduced as soon as possible. This means starting in the labour room itself 
for the well infant. 
• Mother’s own milk (MOM) is the milk of choice for all newborn infants. 
• Normal caloric requirements in: 
 ͳTerm infants: 110 kcal/kg/day 
 ͳPreterm infants: 115 – 140 kcal/kg/day
(Preterm infants who have had a more eventful course need up to 160 kcal/kg/day to have adequate weight 
gain)
MOM is the first choice as studies have shown that breast fed infants have lower risk for necrotizing 
enterocolitis (NEC), lower rates of late onset sepsis and had better neurodevelopment outcomes.
However, MOM alone does not meet the nutritional requirements of the very preterm infant as it has:
• Insufficient calories and protein for optimal early growth.
• Insufficient sodium to compensate for high renal sodium losses.
• Insufficient calcium and phosphate - predisposes to osteopenia of prematurity.
• Low in vitamins and iron relative to the needs of a preterm infant.
When MOM is not available, DHM is preferred over infant formula. 
DHM is associated with reduced NEC rates compared with infant formula.
DHM should be pasteurized.
As with MOM, DHM should be fortified with HMF to meet the nutritional requirements and achieve better 
growth.• Mother’s Own Milk (MOM) 
• Donor Human Milk (DHM)
• Term infant formula
• Term/ Preterm infant formula
• It is recommended to add HMF to MOM in infants <32 weeks or <1500 grams.
• HMF should be added to MOM when enteral feeding is at 50 - 100 ml/kg/day.
*Check the dilution as it may vary between different brands.

Section 6         NEONATOLOGYInfant Formula
When to initiate feeding?
Rate of advancement?Minimal enteral nutrition (MEN)
Strategies of administering enteral feedingInfant formula should only be used when MOM and DHM are not available. 
There are 2 types of infant formula: Preterm formula and term formula.
Preterm formula maybe considered for very preterm (< 32 weeks’ gestation) or < 1500 grams infants
• As soon as possible for the well term infants and hemodynamically stable preterm infants 
• Generally, the rate of advancement is ~20 to 30 ml/kg/day.
• Implementation of standardized feeding protocol in each NICU has been shown to enhance nutrient 
intakes, improve growth and prevent preterm morbidities.
• Routine measurement of gastric residual volume is not recommended in the absence of other signs of 
feeding intolerance.
• IUGR babies with reversed end-diastolic flow on antenatal Doppler should advance slowly and 
preferentially start with MOM or DHM.
• Target feeding volume :
Aim to reach full enteral feeding (150–180mL/kg/day) 
a. ~ 2 weeks in babies weighing <1000 g at birth and
b. ~ 1 week in babies weighing 1000–1500 g 
• Target weight gain rates should be around 15-25g/kg/day.MEN or trophic feeding is recommended in preterm and high-risk infants.
The principle is to commence very low volume enteral feeds (< 25 ml/kg/day) on day 1 - 3 of life.
• MOM or DHM is the preferred type of milk.  
• For extremely low birth weight (ELBW), or growth-restricted infants, if by 24–48 h, MOM or DHM is not 
available, to consider formula milk.
Nasogastric vs Orogastric Route
• Both methods can be used as there is no preference between these two methods
Continuous vs. intermittent bolus feeding.
• There is inadequate evidence to determine whether bolus or continuous feeding is superior in clinically 
stable preterm infants.
• Intermittent bolus feeding is the preferred method. 
• Nutrients (fat and calcium) could be lost when feeding by continuous feeding.
• Continuous feeding may be useful in infants with underlying gastrointestinal disease.
2 hourly versus 3 hourly feeding
• There are no clinically important differences
Cup feeding
• If the infant can suckle and mother is not with the infant, cup feeding is preferable to bottle feeding to 
prevent nipple confusion.
