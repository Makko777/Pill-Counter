Hypokalaemia
Treatment• The daily potassium requirement is 1-2mmol/kg/day.
• Normal values of potassium are:
• Birth - 2 weeks: 3.7 - 6.0mmol/l
• 2 weeks – 3 months: 3.7 - 5.7mmol/l
• 3 months and above: 3.5 - 5.0mmol/l
• Identify and treat the underlying condition.
• Unless symptomatic, a potassium level of 3.0-3.4 mmol/l is generally not supplemented  but rather 
monitored.
• The treatment of hypokalaemia will need to be individualized for each patient.
Oral Supplementation
• Oral Potassium chloride (KCL), to a maximum of 2 mmol/kg/day in divided doses is common 
but more may be required in practice.
Intravenous Supplementation (1gram KCL = 13.3 mmol KCL)
• Potassium chloride is always given by IV infusion, NEVER by bolus injection .
• Maximum concentration via a peripheral vein is 40 mmol/l  (concentrations of up to 60 
mmol/l can be used with specialist advice).
• Maximum infusion rate is 0.2mmol/kg/hour  (in non-ICU setting).
Intravenous Correction (1gram KCL = 13.3 mmol KCL)
• K+ < 2.5 mmol/L may be associated with significant cardiovascular compromise. In the 
emergency situation, an IV infusion KCL may be given
• Dose: initially 0.4 mmol/kg/hr into a central vein, until K+ level is restored.
• Ideally this should occur in an intensive care setting.• Hypokalaemia is defined as serum K+ < 3.4 mmol/l
(Treat if < 3.0mmol/l or clinically symptomatic and < 3.4 mmol/l)
• Causes are:
• Sepsis
• Gastrointestinal losses - diarrhoea, 
vomiting
• Iatrogenic- e.g. diuretic therapy, 
salbutamol, amphotericin B.
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Renal tubular acidosis
• Hypokalaemia is often seen with chloride 
depletion and metabolic alkalosis
• Refractory hypokalaemia may occur with 
hypomagnesaemia.ECG changes of Hypokalemia

Hyperkalaemia
• Causes are:
• Dehydration
• Acute renal failure
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Adrenal insufficiency
• Tumour lysis syndrome
• Drugs e.g. oral potassium supplement,
• K+ sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors.
• Symptoms of Hyperkalaemia:
• Nausea and vomiting
• Fatigue
• Paraesthesia, muscle weakness, paralysis
• Respiratory distress and failure
• Palpitations, syncope, cardiac arrest

Section 5         INTENSIVE CAREHYPERKALAEMIA TREATMENT ALGORITHM
Hyperkalaemia K+ > 5.5 mmol/L
Drug doses:
• IV Calcium 0.1 mmol/kg (IV Calcium gluconate 10% 0.5ml/kg - Max 20 ml or IV Calcium chloride 0.2ml/
kg - Max 10ml). Give over2-5 minutes if unstable or 15-20 minutes if stable under cardiac monitoring.
• Nebulised Salbutamol: 2.5-5mg, repeat as necessary.
• IV Insulin with Glucose:
• Start with IV Glucose 10% 5ml/kg/hr (or 20% at 2.5 ml/kg/hr). Once Blood sugar level >10mmol/l 
and the K+ level is not falling, add IV Insulin 0.05 units/kg/hr and titrate according to glucose level.
• IV Sodium Bicarbonate: 1-2 mmol/kg over 5 minutes if severe or over 30 minutes in mild to moderate 
hyperkalaemia.
• Calcium polystyrene sulfonate (Calcium Resonium) 0.3-0.6g/kg (Adult 15-30g) 6 hourly to be given 
rectally or orally.Child unstable

Acute Gastroenteritis
Introduction
• Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality and an important 
cause of malnutrition.
• Many diarrhoeal deaths are caused by dehydration and electrolytes loss.
• Dehydration can be safely and effectively treated with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) but severe 
dehydration may require intravenous fluid therapy.
First assess the state of perfusion of the child.
Is the child in shock?
• Signs of shock include tachycardia, weak peripheral pulses, delayed capillary refill time >2 seconds, cold 
peripheries, depressed mental state with or without hypotension.
For any child with shock go straight to Treatment Plan C.
You can also use the WHO chart below to assess the degree of dehydration and then choose the treatment 
plan A, B or C, as needed.
Look  at child’s
general conditionWell, alert. Restless or
irritable.Lethargic or
unconscious.
Look  for sunken eyes No sunken eyes. Sunken eyes. Sunken eyes.
Offer  the child
fluidDrinks normally. Drinks eagerly, thirsty. Not able to drink or
drinks poorly.
Pinch  skin of
abdomenSkin goes back

slowly.Skin goes back very
slowly (> 2 secs).

Treat Plan A

Give fluid for severe

Provide food as soon as 
child tolerates.Assess:
*% of body weight (in g) loss in fluid (Fluid Deficit)
e.g. a 10 kg child with 500g weight loss is estimated to have 5% dehydration.
Fluid deficit = 5/100 x 10000g = 500 mls.
