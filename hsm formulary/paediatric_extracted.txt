iiiFOREWORD BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HEALTH, MALAYSIA
1.  First and foremost, I would like to thank the Editorial Board and it is my 
pleasure to write the foreword for the Paediatric Protocols for Malaysia 
Hospital 4th Edition. 
2.  Since independence, the Malaysian health system has achieved remark -
able outcomes in improving the health status of the population. 
Life expectancy at birth has increased by more than 10 years, driven by rapid 
declines in infant, child, and maternal mortality. However, over the past 15 
years, the declines in maternal and child mortality rates have plateaued, 
with no further notable improvement.
3.  Over the years, we have seen the introduction of new technologies in 
health system. Healthcare workers must keep up with current therapeutics 
developments and ensure that they provide safe, appropriate and effective 
treatment to their patients. Clearly, then, the development and maintenance 
of effective therapeutic skills is essential especially to those working in acute 
settings. 
4.  This pocket book is mainly aimed at doctors, clinical officers, nurses and 
other healthcare workers who are responsible for the care of sick newborns 
and young children. These protocols are meant to serve as a guide for clinical 
practice, based on the best available evidence at the time of development. 
Every healthcare worker is responsible for the management of their patient 
based on the clinical features presented by the patient and the management 
options available locally. We hope this handy pocket sized booklet will also be 
useful to students in medical schools and other training institutions.
Datuk  Dr Noor Hisham bin Abdullah
Director-General of Health, Malaysia

ivFOREWORD TO THE FOURTH EDITION, 2ND PRINT
 It has been 13 years since we produced the first edition of a 
national protocol book for Paediatrics. This effort was of course inspired by 
the Sarawak Paediatric Protocols initiated by Dr Tan Poh Tin. The 3rd edition 
in 2012 has proven to be very popular and is now the standard reference for 
House officers and Medical Officers in Paediatrics. 
 In producing a fourth edition we have retained the layout of the 
current version, updating the contents and colour scheme. Again it is targeted 
at young doctors in the service many of whom seem to have had a subopti -
mal exposure to paediatrics in their undergraduate years. It is hoped that the 
protocol book will help them fill in the gaps as they prepare to serve in district 
hospitals and health clinics. The use of the book has extended way beyond its 
initial targeted audience. 
 We want to thank the Ministry of Health of Malaysia which has 
once again agreed to support the printing of the book for distribution to MOH 
facilities. We will continue to make the full PDF version available for download 
on the Malaysian Paediatric Association website.  We hope that in time the 
protocol will be available as an iOS and android app.
 As previously this new edition is only possible because of the will-
ingness of busy clinicians to chip in and update the content for purely altruistic 
reasons and we hope this spirit will persist in our fraternity. We want to thank 
all the contributors and reviewers for this edition. Professor Frank Shann has 
graciously agreed for the latest edition of his drug dosages handbook to be 
incorporated into the 4th edition (only available in MOH prints). The Frank 
Shann-Drug Doses Book (17th edition) can also be purchased through orders@
drugdoses.com, the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google PlayStore (Android). See also 
www.drugdoses.com. The Director General of Health has also kindly provided a 
foreword to this edition. 
 In the 2nd Print of the 4th Edition, we took the opportunity to make 
corrections for errors that were discovered after the document had been in 
circulation for some time.  Minor corrections were made in a few documents.  
 Substantial changes were made to three Chapters. In the Chapter 
109 Common Poisons, an important correction was made to the N-Acetyl -
cysteine dosage regimen for treatment of paracetamol poisoning and the Toxi -
dromes table was expanded, amongst other corrections. Additional material 
and updates were also added to Chapter 32 Asthma and Chapter 36 Empyema 
Thoracis, at the request of the Paediatric Respiratory Physicians.
 We wish to thank all who have made this new edition possible and 
hope this combined effort will help in improving the wellbeing of the children 
entrusted to our care.

7ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
Age Weight Height Head size
Birth 3.5 kg 50 cm 35 cm
6 months 7 kg 68 cm 42 cm
1 year 10 kg 75 cm 47 cm
2 years 12 kg 85 cm 49 cm
3 years 14 kg 95 cm 49.5 cm
4 years 100 cm 50 cm
5-12 years 5 cm/year 0.33 cm/year
Points to Note
Weight
 • In the first 7 - 10 days of life, babies lose 10 - 15% of their birth weight.
 • In the first 3 months of life, the rate of weight gain is 25 gm/day
 • Babies regain  their birth weight by the 2nd week, double  this by 5 months 
    age, and triple  the birth weight by 1 year of age
 • Weight estimation for children (in Kg):
     Infants: (Age in months X 0.5) + 4
                Children 1 – 10 years: (Age in yrs + 4) X 2
Head circumference
 • Rate of growth in preterm infants is 1 cm/week, but reduces with age. 
    Head growth follows that of term infants when chronological age reaches term
 • Head circumference increases by 12 cm in the 1st year of life (6 cm in first 3 
     months, then 3 cm in second 3 months, and 3 cm in last 6 months)
Other normal values are found in the relevant chapters of the book.
