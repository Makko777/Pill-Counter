FOREWORD
DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HEALTH
III am honoured to be given the opportunity to provide the 
foreword for the 5th edition of Paediatric Protocols for Malaysian 
Hospitals.
In this edition, the authors and contirbutors, many of 
whom are respected experts in the the field of paediatrics, 
have once again delivered an outstanding publication. The 
book has broadened its scope, encompassing topics that 
range from fundamental aspects of paediatric care to the 
latest advancements and innovations in chlid health. It stands 
as a comprehensive and authoritative refence, reflecting the 
remarkable growth and maturity of paediatric expertise in 
Malaysia.
This compact guide is designed for medical professionals and healthcare workers involved in the care 
of infants, children, adolescents. The protocols serve as practical guides for clinical practice, based on the 
best available evidence at the time of its development.
Its is essential that frontline medical practitioners are well-prepared to manage common paediatric 
emergencies, enabling timely and appropriate care based on clinical presentations right form the start.
I am confident that this 5th edition will significantly contribute to enhancing the quality of paediatric 
care across Ministry of Health facilities throughout the country.
The collaborative efforts of all involved are truly commendable. I extend my sincere thanks to the 
Editors for their commitment in bringing this important edition for fruition.
Datuk Dr. Mahathar bin Abd Wahab
Director General of Health Malaysia

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
II IIIFOREWORD
TO THE 5TH EDITION
At the 2004 annual meeting of Paediatric Heads of Departments, it was decided to produce a national 
protocol book based on the Sarawak model. The first edition was ready in time for the 2005 annual meeting 
of HODs. However, there were a few hiccups in that production largely because the text was sent to the 
printers as a Word document. Many tables and algorithms were distorted in the final product. Learning 
from this, all subsequent editions were sent in PDF format with the help of Dr. Terrance, who joined the 
editorial board for the 2nd Edition.
This 5th Edition comes after a seven-year lapse. In many ways, this is a transitional edition. Dr. 
Terrance has migrated to Singapore and for the two remaining senior members, HIMI and NHP this will be 
their final production. Three young paediatricians and the current head of service have joined the editorial 
board and will hopefully go on to produce the 6th Edition when the time comes. This is also the first time 
that the officers from the Medical Development Division of the Ministry of Health have been involved in 
formatting the text and the result is a much more elegant product. 
From the beginning, the primary aim of the protocol book has been to improve the care of children in 
primary and secondary care settings within the Ministry of Health. Over time, colleagues in private practice 
and medical students have also benefited from it. This has been made possible by the Malaysian Paediatric 
Association’s willingness to print and distribute additional copies at close to cost price. Most of the 
contributors are tertiary specialists. Despite their busy schedule, they once again volunteered to update the 
material in keeping with new developments and guidelines since the last edition. It is this teamwork and 
collaboration at all levels between members of the fraternity that has contributed to the progress of the 
paediatric services in the country to the current level. We pray that this spirit persists in the years to come.

Points to Note
Weight
• In the first 7 to 10 days, babies lose 10% of their birth weight.
• Babies gain their birth weight by the second week.
• In the first 3 months of life, the rate of weight gain is 25 g/day
• Babies double their birth weight by 5 months old and triple by 1 year old
• Weight estimation for children (in Kg):
Infants: (Age in months X 0.5) + 4
Children 1 – 10 years: (Age in yrs + 4) X 2
Head circumference
• Rate of growth in preterm infants is 1 cm/week, but reduces with age.
• Head growth follows that of term infants when chronological age reaches term
• Head circumference increases by 12 cm in the 1st year of life (6 cm in first 3 months, then 3 cm in 
second 3 months, and 3 cm in last 6 months)
Other normal values are found in the relevant chapters of the book.

Section 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSGeneral Notes2
• Vaccines (inactivated or live) can be given simultaneously (does not impair antibody response or 
increase adverse effect). Administer at different sites unless using combined preparations.
• Sites of administration
 -Oral – rotavirus, live typhoid vaccines
 -Intradermal (ID) - BCG. Left deltoid area (proximal to insertion of deltoid muscle)
 -Intramuscular (IM) - 6 in 1 DTaP-hepB-IPV-Hib (Hexaxim)
 -Deep SC, IM injections. (ALL vaccines except the above)
• Anterolateral aspect of thigh – preferred site in children
• Upper arm – preferred site in adults
• Upper outer quadrant of buttock - associated with lower antibody level production
Immunisation: General contraindications
• Absolute contraindication for any vaccine: severe anaphylaxis reactions to previous dose of the vaccine 
or to a component of the vaccine.
• Postponement during acute febrile illness
• Live vaccines: Absolute contraindications
 -Immunosuppressed children  - malignancy; irradiation, leukaemia, lymphoma, post-transplant, 
primary immunodeficiency syndromes (but NOT asymptomatic HIV): need to defer (see below)
 -Pregnancy (live vaccine - theoretical risk to foetus) UNLESS there is significant exposure to serious 
conditions like polio or yellow fever in which case the importance of vaccination outweighs the risk 
to the foetus.
 -Live vaccines may be given together. If not administering simultaneously then an interval ≥ 4 weeks 
is required.
 -Tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test) and MMR: after a Mantoux test, MMR should be delayed until 
the skin test has been read.
 -There should be ≥ 4 weeks interval for Mantoux test after MMR given.
• Killed vaccines are safe . Absolute contraindications: SEVERE local induration (involving > 2/3 of the 
limbs) or severe generalised reactions in previous dose.
The following are not contraindications to vaccination
• Mild illness without fever e.g. mild diarrhoea, cough, runny nose
• Asthma, eczema, hay fever, impetigo, heat rash (avoid injection in affected area)
• Treatment with antibiotics, locally acting steroids or inhaled steroids
• Child’s mother is pregnant.
• Breastfed child (does not affect polio uptake)
• Neonatal jaundice
• Underweight or malnourished
• Over the recommended age
• Past history of pertussis, measles or rubella (unless confirmed medically)
• Stable neurological conditions: cerebral palsy, mental retardation, febrile convulsions, stable epilepsy
• Family history of convulsions
• History of heart disease, acquired or congenital
• Prematurity (immunise according to schedule irrespective of gestational age)

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSIMMUNISATION: SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES4,5
Immunisation of the Immunocompromised child:
Includes malignancy; leukaemia, lymphoma, post-transplant, congenital immunodeficiency syndromes (but 
NOT asymptomatic HIV), immunosuppressive therapy:
• BCG is contraindicated
• Non-live vaccines can be given but may need to be repeated depending on underlying condition and 
individual vaccine due to suboptimal response
• For oncology patients on chemotherapy:
 ͳAvoid live vaccines for two weeks before, during and for 6 months after completion of 
chemotherapy
 ͳSafe to give influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, if indicated
• For post- Haematopoeitic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) and Solid Organ Transplant (SOT):
 ͳNon-live vaccines can be given 6 months after HSCT or SOT
 ͳLive vaccines to be given at least 2 years after HSCT and no graft versus host disease and not on 
immunosuppressive therapy (and acceptable CD4 count and IgM levels)
 ͳLive vaccines contraindicated in SOT as most likely on immunosuppressive therapy
• Patients on Corticosteroid Therapy:
 ͳOn high-dose steroids i.e. Prednisolone ≥2 mg/kg/day for >14 days, delay live vaccines for at least 1 
month after cessation of steroids
 ͳOn low-dose systemic steroids of 1mg/ kg/day <2 weeks or EOD for >2 weeks, can administer live 
vaccines
 ͳAny dose for ≥28 days, delay live vaccines for at least 1 month after cessation of steroids.
Immunisation of children with immunomodulatory & biologics therapy6,7
• Vaccination with non-live, attenuated vaccines in children on immunomodulation therapies and 
biologics is safe.
• It is recommended to withhold live-attenuated vaccines for these patients on immunomodulatory 
therapies and biologics. However, vaccination can be considered on a case-to-case basis weighing the 
benefit of vaccination against the risk of inducing infection through vaccination.
• Live-attenuated booster vaccinations against Varicella Zoster Virus and MMR can be considered in 
patients on low dose immunosuppressive drugs.
• For vaccination against HPV in patients with Rheumatic Diseases. Given the higher risk of HPV infection 
in female SLE patients, these patients should be advised to be vaccinated in the adolescence. However, 
physicians should be vigilant on potential thromboembolic events.

Section 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSImmunisation of children with HIV infection
(Please refer to Paediatric HIV section)
Immunisation with Antibody-containing preparation:8,9 
• Immunoprophylaxis against viral illness provide susceptible individuals with immunologic protection 
against it.
• Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F glycoprotein, used for the 
prevention of serious RSV lower respiratory tract disease in specialized group of children at high risk of 
RSV infection. It does not interfere with response to routine immunization with live virus vaccines (eg, 
measles, mumps, rubella, varicella)
Children with bleeding disorders including persistent thrombocytopenia, 
haemophilia or patients on anti-coagulant therapy10
• Children with bleeding disorders or on long term anti-coagulant therapy may develop haematoma at 
intramuscular vaccine injection sites
• Thus, it is preferred to use the subcutaneous route instead of the intramuscular route
• Seek expert advice before using an alternative route.
Immunisation of Children with Egg Allergy11 
• Egg allergy is not a contraindication to immunization with MMR.Interval between administration of Immunoglobulins or blood products

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSMeasures to protect inpatients exposed to another inpatient with measles
• Protect all immunocompromised children  with Immunoglobulin (NHIG) 0.25-0.5 mls/kg. (Measles may 
be fatal in children in remission from leukaemia)
• Check status of measles immunisation in the other children. Give measles specific Immunoglobulin, if 
none available to give IVIG to unimmunised children  within 24 hrs of exposure. Immunisation within 72 
hours aborts clinical measles in 75% of contacts.
• Discharge the inpatient child with uncomplicated measles.
• Do not forget to notify the Health Office.
Close contacts of immunodeficient children and adults  
• Must be immunized, particularly against measles, polio (IPV), varicella.
Children with Asplenia  (Elective or emergency splenectomy; asplenic syndromes;
sickle cell anaemia) are susceptible to encapsulated bacteria and malaria.
• Pneumococcal, Meningococcal A, C, Y & W-135, Haemophilus influenza b vaccines should be given.
• For elective splenectomy (and also chemotherapy or radiotherapy): give the vaccines preferably 2 or 
more weeks before the procedure. However, they can be given even after the procedure.
• Penicillin prophylaxis should continue ideally for life. If not, until 16 years old for children or 5 years post 
splenectomy in adults.
In patients with past history or family history of febrile seizures , neurological or developmental 
abnormalities that would predispose to febrile seizures:
• Febrile seizures may occur 5 - 10 days after measles (or MMR) vaccination or within the first 72 hours 
following pertussis immunisation.
• Paracetamol prophylaxis following immunisation is not recommended.
Maternal Chicken Pox during perinatal period
(Please refer to Perinatally acquired varicella section)

women - give one IM dose of ceftriaxone)
• All household < 4 years who is unimmunised or incompletely immunised
• For preschool and child care facility should be at the discretion of local health department
