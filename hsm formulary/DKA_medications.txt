5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 10        ENDOCRINOLOGY• Clinical features suggesting of CH:
• Sluggishness 
• Constipation 
• Hoarseness of voice 
• Poor weight gain 
• Dry skin 
• Prolonged neonatal jaundice 
• Macroglossia 
• Umbilical hernia 
• Cold extremities 
• Wide posterior fontanelle (normal 0.5 x 0.5cm)
• Goitre 
*Beware that majority of newborns with CH do not manifest clinical features at birth until 3 — 6 
months later. 
• Obtain history of risk factors for CH (maternal history of thyroid disease; use of anti-thyroid drug; 
excessive iodine intake e.g. seaweed; maternal iodine deficiency; parental consanguinity; family history 
of thyroid disease; prematurity; low birth weight infant; use of iodine antiseptic solutions).
• Other physical examinations include:
• Growth parameters
• Dysmorphic features
• Features of pituitary hormones deficiency (central hypothyroidism) 
• Congenital malformation e.g. facial midline defect (cleft lip, cleft palate, nasal encephalocele), 
cardiac abnormality particularly atrial and ventricular septal defects, urogenital abnormalities. 
• The venous TFT at Day 4-6 is confirmatory in most cases for diagnosis of CH. Please refer to figure 2  for 
interpretation and recommendation of actions. For some special categories of babies, please refer to 
section on  Special Categorie s. 
• FT4 and TSH should not be interpreted in isolation of each other. 
• The suggested thresholds of FT4 in the recommendations are based on expert opinion and only to 
serve as a guide. An elevated TSH is often the primary determinant in deciding treatment for  primary  
hypothyroidism. 
• In some cases where the results are equivocal, a decision to repeat the test and monitor is a reasonable 
option after discussion with the parents.Clinical evaluation

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGY• Treatment should be started as soon as diagnosis is made. Treatment initiation within 2 weeks of life 
had shown restoration to near-normal IQ in moderate and severe CH. 
• Levothyroxine (LT4) is the treatment of choice for CH. A brand LT4 rather than a generic formulation is 
recommended.
• An initial dose of LT4 at 10-15 mcg/kg/day (maximum 50 mcg/day) is recommended, the lowest dose 
for mild disease and higher dose for severe disease.
• Mild CH (FT4 > 10 pmol/L)                    10 mcg/kg/day 
• Moderate CH (FT4 5–10 pmol/L)         10 mcg/kg/day
• Severe CH (FT4 <5 pmol/L)                   15 mcg/kg/day
• Subclinical CH                                          5-10 mcg/kg/day 
• LT4 should be administered orally in tablet form. LT4 in suspension or syrup form is not recommended. 
• LT4 tablets can be crushed, mixed in small amount of water or milk, and served using a spoon. LT4 
should not be served in a milk-bottle. 
• LT4 is administered in a single daily dose and at a consistent timing every day to ensure compliance. It 
is recommended to take the medication in the morning upon awakening for all ages (expert consensus 
opinion). 
• LT4 can be taken before, with or after food. However, intake of soy, iron or calcium supplementation 
within an hour of LT4 administration should be avoided.
• Serum FT4 and TSH should be measured before, or at least 4 hours after the last LT4 administration. 
• Frequency of TFT monitoring:
• After initiation of LT4, the first clinical and biochemical follow-up should be 1-2 weeks later. If the 
initial dose of LT4 is close to 15 mcg/kg/ day or 50 mcg/day, follow-up should be within 1 week of 
treatment initiation.
• Subsequent clinical and biochemical evaluation should be every 2 weeks until TSH normalises. 
• Thereafter, the evaluation can be reduced to every 1 to 3 months until the age of 12 months. 
• Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, the frequency of evaluations can be lowered to every 2 to 4 
months; thereafter, every 3 to 6 months until growth is completed. 
• TSH normalises slower compared to FT4. The aim is to achieve normalisation of FT4 within 2 weeks of 
treatment, followed by normalisation of TSH within 4 weeks of treatment.
• Serum concentration of TSH should be kept within the age-specific reference range and FT4 in the 
upper half of the age-specific reference range. Over-suppression of TSH to <0.5 mIU/L should be 
avoided. 
• FT4 and TSH should be interpreted together in deciding adjustment of LT4 dose. 
• Evaluations should be performed at more frequent intervals if there is abnormal FT4 or TSH level, or if 
compliance is questioned. 
• After any change in LT4 dose or LT4 formulation, extra follow-up evaluations should be done 4 to 6 
weeks later until FT4 and TSH are normalised. 
• Monitoring for  long term outcomes  includes: 
• Psychomotor and speech development
• Hearing test before school age 
• Growth and puberty
• Compliance to treatment, which is important to future cardiovascular health and pregnancy 
outcome.Treatment

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 10        ENDOCRINOLOGY• All babies treated for CH will need to be re-evaluated to determine if the CH is permanent or transient 
and to establish a possible aetiology. 
• Re-evaluation is done at or after 3 years of age when myelination in the central nervous system is 
complete.4 
• At re-evaluation, LT4 is stopped for 4 weeks or phased out over 4-6 weeks. At the end of this period, 
venous FT4 and TSH are measured:
• If FT4 & TSH are within the normal reference range — LT4 replacement is discontinued and 
TFT monitored for the next 6 months. If TFT remains normal after 6 months, the patient can be 
discharged. 
• If TSH is >10mIU/L — this likely indicates permanent CH. LT4 replacement is resumed, and the 
patient continues regular follow-up. 
• If TSH is <10 mIU/L, but more than upper limit of reference range and FT4 normal — withhold 
LT4 treatment for another 3-4 weeks and FT4 & TSH are re-tested. Long term LT4 replacement is 
indicated if there is structural abnormality of the thyroid gland, or TSH increases to >10 mIU/L, or 
FT4 falls to below the reference range for age, or there are symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. 
• Early re-evaluation can be done at or after the age of 6 months in a CH child who has been known to 
have a gland-in-situ (GIS), and requires a low thyroxine dose of less than 3 mcg/kg/day at the age of 6 
months, as they are likely to have a transient form of CH.
• Re-evaluation may not be required if venous TSH has been persistently >10 mIU/L after 1 year of age 
despite thyroxine replacement, as this most likely indicates a permanent form of CH. 
• In patient confirmed to have permanent form of CH at re-evaluation, thyroid ultrasonography is useful 
to determine the presence, location and anatomy of the thyroid gland. However, its accuracy is operator 
dependent.
• Thyroid scintigraphy may also be considered as it is a more reliable imaging modality to determine the 
aetiology of CH, especially in thyroid ectopia and certain cases of dyshormonogenesis.
The following groups of neonates are at high risk for later development of congenital hypothyroidism 
post-screening. Even though they may have a normal screening tests, it is recommended to have their TFT 
repeated.1 
• Sick neonates  
• Include newborns with perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, those who require respiratory or cardiovascular 
support, or have undergone major surgical procedures. 
• To repeat at 2 weeks after recovery from acute illness.
• Preterm infants below 37 weeks gestation / low birth weight below 2.5kg
• For late preterms who are not admitted or have a short stay in hospital, TFT should be repeated 2 
weeks after initial screening. This may be done as outpatient or at the Maternal and Child Health 
Clinic (MCHC) nearest to their homes. 
• For those who have prolonged stay in hospital, TFT should be repeated at 2 weekly interval until 
discharge and 2 weeks post discharge. In hospital with neonatologists or paediatrician, the interval 
to repeat these tests can be based on the clinical judgement and discretion of attending specialists. 
• LT4 therapy of isolated hypothyroxinaemia without clear elevation of TSH is not recommended. 
• Down syndrome  
• TFT should be repeated at 3-4 weeks of life, even if the newborn screening result is normal. 
• Multiple births  
• Re-testing of TFT should be done in monozygotic twins at 14 days of life. Due to mixing of foetal 
blood, the affected infant may not be detected by the initial newborn screening. Re-evaluation of thyroid function in congenital hypothyroidism

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGY• Infant of mother with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD)  
• TFT to be repeated at day 4 – 6 and at day 10 – 14 of life. 
• As the transplacental maternal autoantibodies persist for 3 — 6 months in the affected babies, 
newborns treated for CH due to maternal AITD should be monitored for at least 6 months. The dose 
of LT4 should be titrated against the TFT and tapered accordingly. 
• Congenital central hypothyroidism (CCH)
• Our TSH-based neonatal screening for CH will miss CCH where TSH is inappropriately low with a 
low FT4. CCH is much rarer compared to congenital primary hypothyroidism, but delayed diagnosis 
and treatment will result in severe consequences as well. Besides, majority of CCH (74-84%) is also 
associated with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. 
• Newborns with the following features are at risk of CCH: 
• Facial mid-line defect e.g. cleft palate or cleft lip, nasal encephalocoele
• Symptoms and signs of pituitary hormones deficiency in a neonate e.g. intractable 
hypoglycaemia, prolonged cholestatic jaundice, micropenis 
• Ocular abnormality e.g. optic nerve hypoplasia 
• All newborns at risk of CCH should be recalled for re-test of venous FT4 and TSH at day 4-6, 
regardless of their initial screening results, and followed up accordingly.
• Newborns with symptoms and signs suggestive of pituitary hormone deficiencies should have 
FT4 and TSH checked, in addition to other pituitary hormones. 
• In babies with CCH and concomitant ACTH deficiency, adequate glucocorticoid replacement 
should precede LT4 treatment to prevent adrenal crisis. 
• The starting dose of LT4 is the same as in primary hypothyroidism. Treatment is monitored by 
measuring FT4 and TSH and aim to keep FT4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference 
range.

Diabetes Mellitus  
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is the most common type of diabetes mellitus in children and 
adolescents. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is on the rising trend among adolescents 
due to obesity. 
• Monogenic diabetes or MODY is a familial form of diabetes that usually presents with a mild, non-
ketotic diabetes presenting during adolescence or early adulthood. 
• Neonatal diabetes should be suspected in infants less than 1 year old. 
• Regardless of the type of diabetes, any child with severe hyperglycemia, ketonemia and metabolic 
abnormalities will initially require insulin therapy.
• The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents should be made based on clinical 
features and biochemical criteria (Refer Table 2: World Health Organization diagnostic criteria*). 
• Autoantibodies testing (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, anti-islet antibody, insulin autoantibodies 
and protein tyrosine phosphatase antibody, (other autoantibodies may be done if available) to confirm 
the diagnosis of T1DM 
• The diagnosis must be confirmed by repeat blood glucose testing in the absence of unequivocal 
hyperglycaemia. 
• The role of HbA1c alone in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus remains unclear and diabetes cannot be 
excluded when the value is <6.5%. Introduction

• Daily insulin dosage varies between individuals and changes over time.  
• The basal-bolus regimen (intermediate-acting insulin/long-acting basal once or twice daily and rapid-
acting/short-acting boluses with meals and snacks) mimics the physiological insulin secretion. 
• Basal insulin constitutes about 30 - 50% of the total daily insulin dose (TDD) requirements; the 
remainder is pre-prandial rapid-acting or short- acting insulin. 
• Insulin pump therapy /continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) offers flexibility, better metabolic 
control and improvement in quality of life without the need for multiple insulin injections. In toddlers, 
pump is a preferred method whenever affordable and expertise available.• During the honeymoon period (partial remission phase) total daily insulin dose is usually 0.5 IU/kg/day 
or less
• Prepubertal children (outside the partial remission phase) usually require insulin of 0.7–1.0 IU/kg/day.
• During puberty, requirements may rise to 1 - 2 IU/kg/day.Management
