PREFACE
The Malaysian National Patient Safety Council Technical Committee onMedication Safety had
put inm uch effort through thevarious stakeholders topromote medication safety culture inboth
thepublic and private healthcare sector .The primary goal ofmedication safety istoensure long
term and continuous quality improvements inhealthcare .One way ofachieving itisby
improving and strengthening medication safe practice .Hence, Pharmaceutical Services
Programme, Ministry ofHealth Malaysia has taken the initiative and prepared the Dilution
Guideline forInjectable Drugs .
The purpose ofthis guideline istoprovide information and facilitate thehealthcare professionals
atalllevel sinthe preparation ofinjectable drugs that are listed inthe Ministry ofHealth
(MOH) drug formulary which require sdilution .This guideline will also serve asapreventive
measure toreduce medication errors related toincorrect dilution and administration of
injectable drugs .

Medication safety has received much attention
after theInstitute ofMedicine had published “To
ErrIsHuman :Building aSafer HealthSystem”
report which was inline with the third World
Health Organization (WHO) Global Patient
Safety Challenge .Errors can never beentirely
eliminated, buttheir numbers andseverity canbe
reduced .Theoccurrence ofmedication errors can
compromise patients’ confidence inhealthcare
system byexposing them totheriskofadverse
drug reactions and increase dhealthcare cost.
Moreover, medication errors arepreventable .
The Malaysian Patient Safety Council, Ministry of
Health (MOH) had put inmuch effort through
thevarious stakeholders topromote medication
safety culture inboth the public and private
healthcare sectors .Pharmaceutical Services
Programme, MOH hasbeen given amandate to
lead theTechnical Working Group ofMedication
Safety atthenational level.Thecommittee, which
comprises various stakeholders, willidentify any
issues related tomedication safety and plan for
ongoing improvements inthequality and safety
ofthe medication management system and
practices .
With the aim ofreducing the risksrelated to
injectable drugs, initiatives have been taken to
establish Dilution Guidelines for Injectable
Drugs topromote safe medication use.Moreover,
errors inintravenously administered medications
may have serious consequences and incident
can happen during preparation, dispensin gandadministration ofthese drugs .There areafew
types ofmedication errors related toinjectable
drugs that are commonly reported to
Medication Error Reporting System (MERS), for
example :incorrect dilution, incorrect route of
administration, incorrect infusion rate and
incorrect diluent .Thus, promoting safe injection
practices and establishment ofstandard for
dilution and administration ofinjectable drugs
arecrucial toensure patient safety .
Ensuring safer care forevery patient, every time,
everywhere isthevision established byWHO as
thegoals towards continuous improvements in
patient safety and managing risks toprevent
harm (particularly “avoidable harm” during
treatment and care) .Hence, medication safety
iseveryone’s responsibility soastomake the
healthcare system safer .This guideline aims to
facilitate the healthcare personnel inpreparing
thedilutions ofdrugs which areavailable inthe
MOH drug lists.The availability ofthis guideline
willassist intheexpansion ofquality clinical care
pharmacy services throughout MOH facilities .
Iwould like tocongratulate the editorial
committee, accreditors and reviewers fortheir
efforts and contributions inthe development
ofthis dilution guideline .Itishoped that this
guideline would beauseful reference forallwho
areinvolved inthedilution and administration of
injectable drugs inthehealthcare facilities .
Allthebest andthank you.FOREWORD

APPENDIX 4: CONVERSIONS &CALCULATIONS
Accurate conversions and calculations of medication dosages are crucial to ensure safe drug  
administration.
1. Metric measures
1milligram (mg) =1,000 micrograms (mcg)
1 gram (g) = 1,000 mg
1kilogram (kg) = 1,000 g
1 liter (L) = 1,000 milliliter (ml)
2. Calculating dosages & administration rates
Concentration ofsolution inm g/m l =mgof drug
m l ofsolution
Infusion rate inmg/minute =mgofdrugx flow rate (ml/hour) ÷60minutes
m l ofsolution
Concentration of solution in mcg/ml =m g  ofdrug x 1,000
m l ofsolution
Infusion rate inmcg/minute = mgofdrug x1,000x flow rate (ml/hour) ÷60minutes
m l ofsolution
Infusion rate in
mcg/kg/minute =  m g  of drug x1,000x flow rate (ml/hour) ÷60 minutes ÷weight inkg
m l ofsolution
Infusion rate in ml/hour = m l of solution÷60 minutes
