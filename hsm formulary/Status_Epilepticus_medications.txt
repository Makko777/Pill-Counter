Section 8         CARDIOLOGYIncomplete Kawasaki Disease
• Clinical features suggestive of KD but fewer than 4 principal clinical criteria
• Frequently encountered in infants < 12 months
• Delayed in diagnosis frequently leads to late institution of treatment and higher incidence of coronary 
artery complications
• Diagnosis should be considered in any young infants presenting with unexplained prolonged fever and 
elevated inflammatory markers
• Low threshold for echocardiography 
Coronary Artery Complications
• Incidence: 20 to 25% in untreated cases; reduced to 1 to 2% with IVIG therapy
• Severity ranges from ectasia, small, medium to giant aneurysms (> 8 mm)
• Majority of small to medium-sized aneurysms regress over next few months
• Giant aneurysms do not regress and are at risk of developing serious complications such as thrombosis, 
acute myocardial infarction, stenosis, rupture and sudden death
• High risk groups of developing coronary artery complications
 ÊAge < 1 year
 ÊSevere inflammation during acute phase (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, low albumin)
 ÊDuration of fever > 2 weeks
 ÊRecurrence of fever after > 48 hours of defervescence Atypical Kawasaki Disease
Kawasaki disease with atypical clinical presentations such as acute abdomen, acute pancreatitis, cholestatic 
jaundice, acute kidney injury and pneumonia.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 8         CARDIOLOGYEchocardiography
• Transthoracic echocardiogram should be performed in all patients with suspected KD to detect coronary 
artery aneurysms at the following timings
 ÊUpon diagnosis
 ÊAt 2 to 3 weeks after disease onset
 ÊAt 6 to 8 weeks after disease onset
• A body surface area-adjusted z-score ≥ 2.5 is considered abnormal and requires follow up measurement 
(https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/z-scores-calculator/)
• Additional findings that may be present: ↓ left ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, pericardial 
effusion
Giant coronary artery aneurysm
Additional anti-platelet or anti-thrombotic treatment should be considered to reduce the risk of acute 
coronary artery thrombosis. The options are
• Oral Clopidogrel
• Oral Warfarin
• Subcutaneous Enoxaparin
• IV Heparin infusionOral Aspirin
• Anti-inflammatory effect
 Ê30 to 50 mg/kg/day in divided dose
 ÊStarted simultaneously with IVIG
• Anti-platelet effect
 Ê3 to 5 mg/kg/day
 ÊStarted 48 to 72 hours after defervescence
 ÊDuration: 6 to 8 weeks or normalization of ESR and platelet count (whichever later) in patients 
without coronary artery abnormality
 ÊIn patients with coronary artery involvement, aspirin should be continued until resolution of lesions 
or indefinitelyIV Immunoglobulin (IVIG)
• 2 g/kg single infusion over 10 - 12 hours
• Divided lower dose may be considered in sick infant who cannot tolerate large volume
• Started as early as possible, preferably within 10 days of disease onset
• May still be beneficial in patients who present after 10 days of illness if persistent fever, presence of 
coronary artery abnormalities or ongoing systemic inflammation (elevated ESR or CRP)Treatment

Section 8         CARDIOLOGYVaccination
• IVIG impairs the efficacy of live-attenuated viral vaccines
• Delay these vaccinations for at least 11 monthsIVIG Resistance
• 10 to 20% of cases
• Persistent or recurrent fever after IVIG plus Aspirin therapy
• Increased risk of developing coronary artery complications
• Treatment options include
 ÊRe-treatment with IVIG 2g/kg
 ÊIV Methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by oral Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day tapers 
over 2 to 3 weeks
 ÊIV Infliximab 5 mg/kg single infusion over 2 hours
Consultation with paediatric cardiologists is advisable
