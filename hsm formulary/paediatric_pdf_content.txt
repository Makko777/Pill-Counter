FOREWORD
DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HEALTH
III am honoured to be given the opportunity to provide the 
foreword for the 5th edition of Paediatric Protocols for Malaysian 
Hospitals.
In this edition, the authors and contirbutors, many of 
whom are respected experts in the the field of paediatrics, 
have once again delivered an outstanding publication. The 
book has broadened its scope, encompassing topics that 
range from fundamental aspects of paediatric care to the 
latest advancements and innovations in chlid health. It stands 
as a comprehensive and authoritative refence, reflecting the 
remarkable growth and maturity of paediatric expertise in 
Malaysia.
This compact guide is designed for medical professionals and healthcare workers involved in the care 
of infants, children, adolescents. The protocols serve as practical guides for clinical practice, based on the 
best available evidence at the time of its development.
Its is essential that frontline medical practitioners are well-prepared to manage common paediatric 
emergencies, enabling timely and appropriate care based on clinical presentations right form the start.
I am confident that this 5th edition will significantly contribute to enhancing the quality of paediatric 
care across Ministry of Health facilities throughout the country.
The collaborative efforts of all involved are truly commendable. I extend my sincere thanks to the 
Editors for their commitment in bringing this important edition for fruition.
Datuk Dr. Mahathar bin Abd Wahab
Director General of Health Malaysia

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
II IIIFOREWORD
TO THE 5TH EDITION
At the 2004 annual meeting of Paediatric Heads of Departments, it was decided to produce a national 
protocol book based on the Sarawak model. The first edition was ready in time for the 2005 annual meeting 
of HODs. However, there were a few hiccups in that production largely because the text was sent to the 
printers as a Word document. Many tables and algorithms were distorted in the final product. Learning 
from this, all subsequent editions were sent in PDF format with the help of Dr. Terrance, who joined the 
editorial board for the 2nd Edition.
This 5th Edition comes after a seven-year lapse. In many ways, this is a transitional edition. Dr. 
Terrance has migrated to Singapore and for the two remaining senior members, HIMI and NHP this will be 
their final production. Three young paediatricians and the current head of service have joined the editorial 
board and will hopefully go on to produce the 6th Edition when the time comes. This is also the first time 
that the officers from the Medical Development Division of the Ministry of Health have been involved in 
formatting the text and the result is a much more elegant product. 
From the beginning, the primary aim of the protocol book has been to improve the care of children in 
primary and secondary care settings within the Ministry of Health. Over time, colleagues in private practice 
and medical students have also benefited from it. This has been made possible by the Malaysian Paediatric 
Association’s willingness to print and distribute additional copies at close to cost price. Most of the 
contributors are tertiary specialists. Despite their busy schedule, they once again volunteered to update the 
material in keeping with new developments and guidelines since the last edition. It is this teamwork and 
collaboration at all levels between members of the fraternity that has contributed to the progress of the 
paediatric services in the country to the current level. We pray that this spirit persists in the years to come.

Points to Note
Weight
• In the first 7 to 10 days, babies lose 10% of their birth weight.
• Babies gain their birth weight by the second week.
• In the first 3 months of life, the rate of weight gain is 25 g/day
• Babies double their birth weight by 5 months old and triple by 1 year old
• Weight estimation for children (in Kg):
Infants: (Age in months X 0.5) + 4
Children 1 – 10 years: (Age in yrs + 4) X 2
Head circumference
• Rate of growth in preterm infants is 1 cm/week, but reduces with age.
• Head growth follows that of term infants when chronological age reaches term
• Head circumference increases by 12 cm in the 1st year of life (6 cm in first 3 months, then 3 cm in 
second 3 months, and 3 cm in last 6 months)
Other normal values are found in the relevant chapters of the book.

Section 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSGeneral Notes2
• Vaccines (inactivated or live) can be given simultaneously (does not impair antibody response or 
increase adverse effect). Administer at different sites unless using combined preparations.
• Sites of administration
 -Oral – rotavirus, live typhoid vaccines
 -Intradermal (ID) - BCG. Left deltoid area (proximal to insertion of deltoid muscle)
 -Intramuscular (IM) - 6 in 1 DTaP-hepB-IPV-Hib (Hexaxim)
 -Deep SC, IM injections. (ALL vaccines except the above)
• Anterolateral aspect of thigh – preferred site in children
• Upper arm – preferred site in adults
• Upper outer quadrant of buttock - associated with lower antibody level production
Immunisation: General contraindications
• Absolute contraindication for any vaccine: severe anaphylaxis reactions to previous dose of the vaccine 
or to a component of the vaccine.
• Postponement during acute febrile illness
• Live vaccines: Absolute contraindications
 -Immunosuppressed children  - malignancy; irradiation, leukaemia, lymphoma, post-transplant, 
primary immunodeficiency syndromes (but NOT asymptomatic HIV): need to defer (see below)
 -Pregnancy (live vaccine - theoretical risk to foetus) UNLESS there is significant exposure to serious 
conditions like polio or yellow fever in which case the importance of vaccination outweighs the risk 
to the foetus.
 -Live vaccines may be given together. If not administering simultaneously then an interval ≥ 4 weeks 
is required.
 -Tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test) and MMR: after a Mantoux test, MMR should be delayed until 
the skin test has been read.
 -There should be ≥ 4 weeks interval for Mantoux test after MMR given.
• Killed vaccines are safe . Absolute contraindications: SEVERE local induration (involving > 2/3 of the 
limbs) or severe generalised reactions in previous dose.
The following are not contraindications to vaccination
• Mild illness without fever e.g. mild diarrhoea, cough, runny nose
• Asthma, eczema, hay fever, impetigo, heat rash (avoid injection in affected area)
• Treatment with antibiotics, locally acting steroids or inhaled steroids
• Child’s mother is pregnant.
• Breastfed child (does not affect polio uptake)
• Neonatal jaundice
• Underweight or malnourished
• Over the recommended age
• Past history of pertussis, measles or rubella (unless confirmed medically)
• Stable neurological conditions: cerebral palsy, mental retardation, febrile convulsions, stable epilepsy
• Family history of convulsions
• History of heart disease, acquired or congenital
• Prematurity (immunise according to schedule irrespective of gestational age)

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSIMMUNISATION: SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES4,5
Immunisation of the Immunocompromised child:
Includes malignancy; leukaemia, lymphoma, post-transplant, congenital immunodeficiency syndromes (but 
NOT asymptomatic HIV), immunosuppressive therapy:
• BCG is contraindicated
• Non-live vaccines can be given but may need to be repeated depending on underlying condition and 
individual vaccine due to suboptimal response
• For oncology patients on chemotherapy:
 ͳAvoid live vaccines for two weeks before, during and for 6 months after completion of 
chemotherapy
 ͳSafe to give influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, if indicated
• For post- Haematopoeitic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) and Solid Organ Transplant (SOT):
 ͳNon-live vaccines can be given 6 months after HSCT or SOT
 ͳLive vaccines to be given at least 2 years after HSCT and no graft versus host disease and not on 
immunosuppressive therapy (and acceptable CD4 count and IgM levels)
 ͳLive vaccines contraindicated in SOT as most likely on immunosuppressive therapy
• Patients on Corticosteroid Therapy:
 ͳOn high-dose steroids i.e. Prednisolone ≥2 mg/kg/day for >14 days, delay live vaccines for at least 1 
month after cessation of steroids
 ͳOn low-dose systemic steroids of 1mg/ kg/day <2 weeks or EOD for >2 weeks, can administer live 
vaccines
 ͳAny dose for ≥28 days, delay live vaccines for at least 1 month after cessation of steroids.
Immunisation of children with immunomodulatory & biologics therapy6,7
• Vaccination with non-live, attenuated vaccines in children on immunomodulation therapies and 
biologics is safe.
• It is recommended to withhold live-attenuated vaccines for these patients on immunomodulatory 
therapies and biologics. However, vaccination can be considered on a case-to-case basis weighing the 
benefit of vaccination against the risk of inducing infection through vaccination.
• Live-attenuated booster vaccinations against Varicella Zoster Virus and MMR can be considered in 
patients on low dose immunosuppressive drugs.
• For vaccination against HPV in patients with Rheumatic Diseases. Given the higher risk of HPV infection 
in female SLE patients, these patients should be advised to be vaccinated in the adolescence. However, 
physicians should be vigilant on potential thromboembolic events.

Section 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSImmunisation of children with HIV infection
(Please refer to Paediatric HIV section)
Immunisation with Antibody-containing preparation:8,9 
• Immunoprophylaxis against viral illness provide susceptible individuals with immunologic protection 
against it.
• Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F glycoprotein, used for the 
prevention of serious RSV lower respiratory tract disease in specialized group of children at high risk of 
RSV infection. It does not interfere with response to routine immunization with live virus vaccines (eg, 
measles, mumps, rubella, varicella)
Children with bleeding disorders including persistent thrombocytopenia, 
haemophilia or patients on anti-coagulant therapy10
• Children with bleeding disorders or on long term anti-coagulant therapy may develop haematoma at 
intramuscular vaccine injection sites
• Thus, it is preferred to use the subcutaneous route instead of the intramuscular route
• Seek expert advice before using an alternative route.
Immunisation of Children with Egg Allergy11 
• Egg allergy is not a contraindication to immunization with MMR.Interval between administration of Immunoglobulins or blood products

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 1         GENERAL PAEDIATRICSMeasures to protect inpatients exposed to another inpatient with measles
• Protect all immunocompromised children  with Immunoglobulin (NHIG) 0.25-0.5 mls/kg. (Measles may 
be fatal in children in remission from leukaemia)
• Check status of measles immunisation in the other children. Give measles specific Immunoglobulin, if 
none available to give IVIG to unimmunised children  within 24 hrs of exposure. Immunisation within 72 
hours aborts clinical measles in 75% of contacts.
• Discharge the inpatient child with uncomplicated measles.
• Do not forget to notify the Health Office.
Close contacts of immunodeficient children and adults  
• Must be immunized, particularly against measles, polio (IPV), varicella.
Children with Asplenia  (Elective or emergency splenectomy; asplenic syndromes;
sickle cell anaemia) are susceptible to encapsulated bacteria and malaria.
• Pneumococcal, Meningococcal A, C, Y & W-135, Haemophilus influenza b vaccines should be given.
• For elective splenectomy (and also chemotherapy or radiotherapy): give the vaccines preferably 2 or 
more weeks before the procedure. However, they can be given even after the procedure.
• Penicillin prophylaxis should continue ideally for life. If not, until 16 years old for children or 5 years post 
splenectomy in adults.
In patients with past history or family history of febrile seizures , neurological or developmental 
abnormalities that would predispose to febrile seizures:
• Febrile seizures may occur 5 - 10 days after measles (or MMR) vaccination or within the first 72 hours 
following pertussis immunisation.
• Paracetamol prophylaxis following immunisation is not recommended.
Maternal Chicken Pox during perinatal period
(Please refer to Perinatally acquired varicella section)
In contacts of a patient with invasive Haemophilus influenzae B disease
• Immunise:
• Index case irrespective of age.
• All household, nursery or kindergarden contacts < 4 years of age.
• Chemoprophylaxis: Rifampicin at 20 mg/kg once daily (Maximum 600 mg) for 4 days (except pregnant 
women - give one IM dose of ceftriaxone)
• All household < 4 years who is unimmunised or incompletely immunised
• For preschool and child care facility should be at the discretion of local health department
Babies born to mothers who are Hbe Ag OR Hbs Ag positive  should be given Hepatitis B immunoglobulin 
(200 IU) and vaccinated with the Hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours and not later than 48 hours. Given in 
different syringes and at different sites
Premature infants  may be immunised at the same chronological age as term infants. (Please refer The 
Premature Infant section).

Chapter 4:
Global Developmental Delay (GDD)
• Global developmental delay (GDD) is defined as a delay in two or more developmental domains of 
gross/fine motor, speech/language, cognition, social/ personal and activities of daily living, affecting 
children under the age of 5 years.
History
• Family history:  three-generations review exploring recurrent miscarriages, birth defects, infant deaths, 
neurologic conditions, genetic conditions, ethnic background and consanguinity.
• Psychosocial history : parental education, employment, parental drug or alcohol abuse, child care 
arrangements and history of abuse/ neglect, involvement of child protective services.
• Prenatal history : prenatal ultrasound, maternal smoking, illness, diabetes or hypertension, infections, 
exposure to medications or toxins
• Birth history : Growth parameters (weight and height, head circumference), significant events at birth 
and/or perinatal period, Apgar score, length of hospitalization.
Developmental milestones
• Current functioning of the child across the various developmental domains (gross motor, fine motor and 
vision, language and hearing, personal-social skills including activities of daily living).
• Play (solitary vs. parallel vs. interactive play, choice of toys).
• Atypical development, e.g. perseverance/obsessions/ compulsions, rigidity, motor mannerisms, sensory 
issues, atypical language (echolalia, odd prosody).
• Behaviour in different settings, e.g. home vs. play school.
• Play school/preschool performance, e.g. academics, behaviour, socialisation skills with peers, reports 
from teachers.
• Reports from professionals working with the child, e.g. therapists.
• Early temperament in infancy, e.g. social responsiveness, feeding, sleeping, crying.
• History of any developmental regression.
• Dietary history, sleep habits.
Physical examination
• Growth parameters, head shape, fontanelle, dysmorphic features, congenital abnormalities, cutaneous 
stigmata, spine.

Investigations
A stepwise approach to investigations following clinical evaluation is recommended.
• Formal vision and hearing testing must be done.
• Blood: full blood count, renal profile-electrolytes (to calculate anion gap), AST, ALT, thyroid function test, 
creatine kinase, ammonia, lactate, amino acids, acylcarnitine profile, homocysteine, ferritin, vitamin 
B12 when dietary restriction or pica are present, lead level when risk factors for exposure are present.
• Selection of tests should be tailored to the history, examination and developmental diagnosis of a 
given child.
• Avoid “routine metabolic screening”.
• Urine: organic acid, creatine metabolites, glycosaminoglycans, purines and pyrimidines.
• Genetic testing - molecular karyotyping, specific tests eg Fragile X (FRAXA/ FRAXE PCR), Prader Willi or 
Angelman syndrome.
• Refer to Clinical Geneticist (where services are available) if patient is syndromic.
• MRI brain is recommended for patients with microcephaly, macrocephaly, seizures or abnormal 
neurological findings.
• EEG if history of seizures.
Management
• Family counselling.
• Refer to rehabilitation services (ie occupational therapy, speech therapy, physiotherapy) while awaiting 
formal diagnosis/ results of investigations.
• Emphasize on the importance of early intervention programme.
• Provide parents/ caregivers with online links and local support available.
• Follow up 4-6 monthly to review progress.
• Initiate registration as a child with special needs when appropriate.

Chapter 5:
Communication Disorders and Sensory Impairment
Speech and language delay is associated with difficulty in learning, attention and socialization. In 
children with delayed speech and language, a comprehensive developmental evaluation is important as 
presentation may be part of other developmental problems manifesting as language problems.1. Speech and Language Impairment• Disorders of communication include deficits in language, speech and communication.
• Sensory impairment includes hearing and visual impairment.
Language Disorder (DSM-5-TR Diagnostic Criteria)
A. Persistent difficulties in language (spoken, written, sign language) due to deficits in comprehension 
or production that include:
• Reduced vocabulary
• Limited sentence structure
• Impairments in narrating an event or having a conversation.
B. Language abilities are below those expected for age, limiting effective communication, social 
participation and/or academic achievement.
C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
D. Not attributed to hearing/sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, medical/neurological condition. 
Not due to intellectual disability or global developmental delay.Component Assessment
Speech Expressive production of sounds and includes articulation, fluency, voice 
and resonance quality.
Language Form, function, and use of conventional system of symbols (i.e. spoken
words, sign language, written words, pictures) for communication.
Expressive Language Production of vocal, gestural or verbal signals.
Receptive Language Receiving and comprehending language messages.
Assessments of speech, language and communication abilities must take into account both 
expressive and receptive component and the child’s spoken language at home.

Managing children with language impairment
History
• Identify risk factors. Positive family history of language disorders is often present.
• Rule out hearing or other sensory impairment.
• Intellectual disability (ID). Language delay can be presenting feature of ID. A separate diagnosis is not 
given unless language deficits clearly exceed intellectual limitations.
• Neurological disorders. Language disorder can be acquired in association with neurological disorders, 
including epilepsy (e.g. acquired aphasia or Landau-Kleffner syndrome).
• Language regression. Loss of speech and language in a young child maybe a sign of Autism Spectrum 
Disorder (ASD) or a neurodegenerative disorder (e.g. adrenoleukodystrophy).
• Look for comorbidities especially specific learning disorder, ADHD, ASD and developmental coordination 
disorder.
Physical Examination
• Growth parameters & general examination.
• Hearing impairment.
• Complete neurological examination.
• Developmental assessment.
Management
• Hearing assessment
       (even if hearing impairment is not suggestive in history).
• Referral to speech therapist .
• Parental education to focus on language stimulation activities, Early Intervention Program options.
• Will require follow up to monitor progress and to rule out Learning Disorders in an older child.Section 2         DEVELOPMENTAL PAEDIATRICS

Detailed history eliciting parental concerns, examination of children’s eyes and vision and observation 
of visual behaviour of children presenting with neurodevelopmental problems is essential for early 
identification of visual impairments.
Children with suspected visual impairment require early referral to an ophthalmologist, developmental 
guidance with appropriate early intervention and school placement.3. Visual Impairment
Common visual disorders among children are squint, amblyopia and optical problems impairing visual 
acuity. Poor visual behaviour or presence of squint or abnormal eye movements can be presenting

The H.E.A.D.S.S. Assessment
A Psychosocial Interview for Adolescents
Introduction
Adolescence is the developmental phase between childhood and adulthood and is marked by rapid changes 
in physical, psychosocial, sexual, moral and cognitive growth.
Dr. Cohen refined a system for organizing the developmentally-appropriate psychosocial history that 
was developed in 1972 by Dr. Harvey Berman. The approach is known by the acronym HEADSS (Home, 
Education / employment, peer group Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, and Suicide/depression). It was 
subsequently expanded to HEEADSSS by adding Eating and Safety.
Preparing for the Interview
Parents, family members, or other adults should not be present during the HEADSS assessment unless the 
adolescent specifically gives permission, or asks for it.
Starting the interview
1. Introduction
Set the stage by introducing yourself to the adolescent and parents. If the parents are present before 
the interview, always introduce yourself to the adolescent first.
2. Understanding of Confidentiality
Ask the adolescent to explain their understanding of confidentiality.
3. Confidentiality Statement
After the adolescent has given you his/her views, acknowledge his/her response and add your views 
accordingly (confidentiality statement), based on the particular situation.
The HEADSS assessment Items are in listed in the following pages
Suggestions for ending interviews with adolescents
• Give them an opportunity to express any concerns you have not covered, and ask for feedback about 
the interview.
• Ask if there is any information you can provide on any of the topics you have discussed. Try to provide 
whatever educational materials young people are interested in.

End of Life Care in Children
Introduction
Paediatric palliative care is an active and total approach to care embracing physical, emotional and spiritual 
elements. It focuses on quality of life for the child and support for the family and includes management of 
distressing symptoms, provision of respite and care through death and bereavement.1
When the disease trajectory of the child has reached the final days, actively dying is generally defined as the 
hours or days preceding imminent death during which time, the patient’s physiologic functions wane.2
During this phase, the principles of care are tailored for:
• The Child
• The Parents/Carers/Family Members
• The Child’s and Carer’s Environment
For the Child
• Aim to provide good symptom management.
refer to Table 1: Symptom Control in Dying Children .
• Symptom Care Plan
• An individualized step-approached care plan based on distress symptoms which may occur during 
the active dying phase, with steps of symptom management for family or local medical team and 
contact information for further consultation with key palliative care providers.
• Communication
• Provides clear, understandable, consistent, up-to-date, either verbally or in written form for 
the child based on topics important to them, by taking into account their age and level of 
understanding, and the concerns of parents or carers. If possible, the child should be involved in all 
aspects of decisionmaking, including Advanced Care Planning.
• Provides regular opportunity to discuss with the children about their emotional, psychological and 
spiritual concerns13 either by direct discussion, or through play, art and music activities.
• Discontinuation of unnecessary interventions such as routine observations, routine blood tests, and the 
use of intravenous or subcutaneous fluids and rationalisation of prescribed medicines.Behaviour and
mental stateprofound tiredness and weakness, reduced interest towards surroundings, feeling 
irritable, hallucination, lack of concentration, restlessness.
Breathing changes in breathing pattern or noisy breathing
Circulation signs of reduced peripheral circulation (skin colour and capillary refill time)
Oral intake and
eliminationdifficulty in swallowing medicine, reduced interest in food and fluid intake, reduced 
urine and stool output.Signs and symptoms that a child is actively dying: 3,4,5,6

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 4         PALLIATIVE CAREFor Parents/Carers/Family members
• Revision of Advance Care Planning – the care plan should be reviewed regularly, at appropriate 
intervals. It should contain:
• Demographic information about the children and their family.
• Up-to-date contact information of both parents/carers and key involved professionals.
• A statement about who has the responsibility for giving consent.
• Discuss and provide information about funeral arrangements.
• Provide parents/carers the information of professional contacts (including ambulance services and 
key palliative care providers) in the event of further deterioration and death at home.
• Revisit the parents/carers’ understanding of the methods of home medication administration.
• Offer parents/carers the support and guidance of how to talk about the impending death of their 
child with other siblings.
• Provides parents/carers the access to respite care, if available.
• Offer school visit to meet with the staff of the school of the children and their siblings if necessary. 
It provides the chance for school staff to address their concerns regarding their care and support for 
the child or siblings in the educational setting.
• Based on availability of resources and parents/carers concerns, they should be provided with 
financial support, spiritual or chaplaincy support and emotional support by the named key 
providers.
• After the death of the child, parents/carers should be provided information and support regarding 
process of transferring home (if died in hospital), registration of death, organ donation, and the 
subsequent plan for bereavement support.
For the Child’s and Carer’s Environment
• The child and their parents/carers should be offered hospice referral (if available and agreed by the 
child and the parents/carers), as well as the continued communication with local shared care hospital or 
community teams if their preferred place of care and death is at home.
• Ambience, private room /environment should be provided (if available) which allow the family 
members to have free access to visit the child in hospital.

Paediatric Fluid and Electrolyte Guidelines
Well children with Normal hydration
• Children who are well rarely require intravenous fluids (IV). Whenever possible, use an enteral (oral or 
nasogastric/orogastric tube) route for fluids.
• These guidelines apply to children who are unable to tolerate enteral fluids.
• The safe use of IV fluid therapy in children requires accurate prescribing of fluids and careful monitoring 
because incorrectly prescribed or administered fluids are hazardous.
• If IV fluid therapy is required then maintenance fluid requirements should be calculated using the 
Holliday and Segar formula based on ideal body weight .
• However, the above calculation should serve as an initiation volume and adjusted according to 
individual’s response to fluid therapy. Patient should be monitored closely by clinical observation, fluid 
balance, weight and regular electrolyte profile.
Prescribing Intravenous fluids
Fluids are given intravenously for the following reasons:
• Fluid resuscitation.
• Replacement of
• previous fluid and electrolyte deficit due to dehydration.
• ongoing losses.
• Maintenance of daily fluid requirement.
• A balanced solution is made to a physiological pH and isotonic salt concentration.
• If electrolytes are outside the normal range, discuss with a specialist as necessary.
• 0.45% Saline +/- Glucose should be used in special circumstances with close sodium monitoring to avoid 
hyponatremia.
• Electrolyte composition may vary slightly between different IV solution brands.For Resuscitation • Bolus.
• Crystalloids : 0.9% Sodium chloride, balanced solution e.g. Hartmann’s 
solution or Sterofundin.
• Colloids : e.g. 5% Albumin can be considered after 20-40ml/kg of crystalloids.
(Evidence against usage of starch-based fluids).
For Replacement • Dehydration or ongoing losses.
• 0.9% Sodium chloride.
• Hartmann’s solution /Ringer’s lactate or Sterofundin if there is 
hyperchloremic acidosis.
For Maintenance • 0.9% Sodium chloride + 5% Dextrose
• +/- Potassium chloride
• Alternatively in special circumstances:
• 0.45% Sodium chloride + 5% Dextrose +/- Potassium chloride OR
• Balanced solution +/- glucosePrescribing Intravenous Fluids

Section 5         INTENSIVE CAREResuscitation
• Fluid deficit severe enough to cause impaired tissue oxygenation (clinical shock)  should be corrected 
with a fluid bolus of 10-20 mls/kg over 10-20 minutes .
• Always reassess circulation and look for signs of fluid overload after each fluid bolus  - give repeat 
boluses if indicated and no signs of fluid overload.
• Look for the cause of circulatory collapse  - blood loss, sepsis, etc. This helps to decide on the 
appropriate choice of resuscitation fluid.
• Smaller fluid boluses of 5 mls/kg in selected situations  - e.g. cardiac illness.
• Fluid bolus should be given over 30 minutes to 1 hour in specific conditions, e.g. Diabetic ketoacidosis 
and Dengue Shock.
• Consider 5% albumin as 1st choice in resuscitation of patient with extremely low albumin e.g. nephrotic 
syndrome.
• Avoid low sodium-containing (hypotonic) solutions and glucose-containing solutions  for resuscitation 
as these may cause hyponatraemia and cerebral oedema.
• Measure blood glucose: treat hypoglycaemia with bolus 2-3mls/kg of 10% Dextrose solution  followed 
by dextrose containing solutions (5-10%) as maintenance fluid.
• Measure Na, K and glucose  at the beginning and at least 24-hourly (more frequent testing is indicated 
for ill patients or patients with co-morbidities). Rapid electrolyte values can be obtained from blood 
gases.
• Consider septic work-up and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage or surgical consult  in severely unwell 
patients with abdominal symptoms to rule out acute surgical conditions, e.g. perforated viscus.Crystalloids • 0.9% Normal Saline

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 5         INTENSIVE CAREMaintenance
Calculation of Maintanence Fluid Requirements• Maintenance fluid is the volume of daily fluid intake. It includes insensible losses (from breathing, 
perspiration, and in the stool), and allows for excretion of the daily production of excess solute load 
(urea, creatinine, electrolytes) in the urine.
• Most children will tolerate standard fluid requirements using the Holliday and Segar formula. However, 
some acutely ill children with inappropriately increased anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) 
may benefit from their maintenance fluid requirement being restricted to two-thirds of the normal 
recommended volume.
• Children should be monitored for hyponatremia or hypernatremia. These include children with the 
following conditions:
• Peri-or post-operative state
• Require replacement of ongoing losses
• A plasma Na+ at lower range of normal (definitely if < 135mmol/L)
• Intravascular volume depletion or hypotension
• Central nervous system (CNS) infection
• Head injury
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Bronchiolitis
• Sepsis
• Excessive gastric or diarrheal losses
• Salt-wasting syndromes
• Chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis and pituitary deficits.
The following calculations approximate the maintenance fluid requirement of well children according to 
weight in kg (Holliday-Segar calculator). Use ideal weight for calculation in obese children.
Example: A Child of 29 kg will require:Weight Total fluids Infusion rate
First 10 Kgs 100 ml/kg 4 ml/kg/hour
Subsequent 10 Kgs 50 ml/kg 2 ml/kg/hour
All additional Kg 20 ml/kg 1 ml/kg/hour
100ml/kg for first 10kg of weight 10 x 100 = 1000 ml
50ml/kg for second 10kg of weight 10 x 50 = 500 ml
20ml/kg for all additional weight 9 x 20 = 180 ml

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 5         INTENSIVE CAREDeficit
Ongoing losses (e.g. from drains, ileostomy, profuse diarrhoea)• A child’s water deficit in mls can be calculated following an estimation of the degree of dehydration 
expressed as % of body weight.
• These are best measured and replaced. Any fluid losses > 0.5ml/kg/hr needs to be replaced.
• Calculation may be based on each previous hour, or each 4-hour period depending on the situation. 
E.g., a 200mls loss over the previous 4 hours will be replaced with a rate of 50mls/hr for the next 4 
hours).
• Ongoing losses can be replaced with 0.9% Normal Saline or balanced solution. Fluid loss with high 
protein content leading to low serum albumin can be replaced with 5% Human Albumin.• The deficit is replaced over a time period that varies according to the child’s condition. Precise 
calculations (e.g. 4.5%) are not necessary. The rate of rehydration should be adjusted with ongoing 
clinical assessment.
• Use an isotonic solution for replacement of the deficit, e.g. 0.9% saline or balanced solutions.
• Reassess clinical status and weight at 4-6hours, and if satisfactory continue. If child is losing weight, 
increase the fluid and if weight gain is excessive, decrease the fluid rate.
• Replacement may be rapid in most cases of gastroenteritis (best achieved by oral or nasogastric fluids), 
but should be slower in diabetic ketoacidosis and meningitis, and much slower in hypernatremic states 
(aim to rehydrate over 48-72 hours, the serum Na should not fall by >0.5mmol/l/hr or >10-12 mmol/L 
per 24 hours).Example: A 10kg child who is 5% dehydration has a water deficit of 500mls.
Maintenance
Deficit (give over 24hours)100mls/kg for first 10 kg = 10 × 100 = 1000ml
Infusion rate/hour = 1000ml/24 hr = 42ml/hr
5% dehydration (5% of body water): 5/100 × 10kg × 1000ml = 500ml
Infusion rate/hour (given over 24 hrs)                           = 500ml/24 hr = 21ml/hr

Section 5         INTENSIVE CARESODIUM DISORDERS
Special considerationsHypernatraemia
Management• The daily sodium requirement is 2-3mmol/kg/day.
• Normal serum sodium is between 135-145mmol/l .
• Use a slower rate in chronic Hypernatraemia (present for > 5 days).
• Measure calcium and glucose . Hypernatraemia can be associated with hypocalcaemia and 
hyperglycaemia, which need to be corrected concurrently.For hypernatraemic dehydration with Na+> 150mmol/l:
• If the patient is in shock, give volume resuscitation with 0.9% Normal saline as required with bolus/
es.
• Avoid rapid correction  (may cause cerebral oedema, convulsion and death).
• Aim to correct deficit over 48-72 hours and fall of serum Na+ ≤ 0.5mmol/L/hr.
• Give 0.9% Sodium chloride to ensure the drop in sodium is not too rapid (<10-12mmol/L per day).
• Remember to give maintenance fluids and replace ongoing losses.
• Repeat blood urea and electrolytes  every 6 hours until stable.
• If hypernatraemia worsens or is unchanged after replacing deficit, review fluid type and consider 
changing to a hypotonic solution (e.g. 0.45% Sodium chloride with dextrose).
• If no evidence of dehydration and an isotonic fluid is being used, consider changing to a hypotonic fluid 
(e.g. 0.45% Sodium chloride with dextrose).
• If the fluid status is uncertain, measure urine sodium and osmolality. When correcting hypernatraemia, 
ensure that the rate of fall of plasma sodium < 12 mmol/litre in a 24-hour period (0.5mmol/l/hour).
• Measure plasma electrolytes every 4–6 hrs for the first 24 hrs, and the frequency of further electrolyte 
measurements depends on response.• Hypernatraemia is defined as serum Na+ > 150mmol/l , moderate hypernatraemia = serum Na+ is 
150-160mmol/l, and severe hypernatraemia = serum Na+ > 160mmol/l.
• It can be due to:
• water loss in excess of sodium (e.g. 
diarrhoea)
• water deficit
(e.g. diabetes insipidus)
• sodium gain
(e.g. large amount of NaHCO 3 
infusion or salt poisoning).
• Children may appear sicker than expected for degree of dehydration.
• Shock occurs late because intravascular volume is relatively preserved .
• Signs of hypernatraemic dehydration tend to be predominantly that of intracellular dehydration and 
neurological dysfunction.
• In hypernatraemia due to central diabetes insipidus , consult Endocrinology.Clinical signs of Hypernatraemic dehydration

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 5         INTENSIVE CAREHyponatraemia
• Hyponatraemia is defined when serum Na+ < 135mmol/l.
• Hyponatraemic encephalopathy  is a medical emergency that requires rapid recognition and treatment 
to prevent poor outcome.
• Symptoms  associated with acute hyponatraemia during IV fluid therapy: Headache, nausea, vomiting, 
confusion, disorientation, irritability, lethargy, reduced consciousness, convulsions, coma, apnoea.
Calculating sodium correction in acute hyponatremia
mmol of sodium required                  = (135-present Na level)× 0.6 × weight(kg)
The calculated requirements can then be given from the following available solutions dependent on the 
availability and hydration status:
0.9% sodium chloride contains 154 mmol/l of Sodium
3% sodium chloride contains 513mmol/l of Sodium
• In acute symptomatic hyponatraemia in term neonates and children, review the fluid status, seek 
immediate expert advice (for example, from the paediatric intensive care team) and consider taking 
action as follows:
• A 2 ml/kg bolus (max 100 ml) of 3% Sodium chloride over 10–15 mins.
• A further 2 ml/kg bolus (max 100 ml) of 3% Sodium chloride over the next 10–15 mins if symptoms 
are still present after the initial bolus.
• If symptoms are still present after the 2nd bolus, check plasma sodium level and consider a third 
2ml/kg bolus (max 100 ml) of 3% Sodium Chloride over 10–15 mins.
• Measure the plasma sodium concentration at least hourly.
• As symptoms resolve, decrease the frequency of plasma sodium measurements based on the 
response to treatment.
• Do not manage acute hyponatraemic encephalopathy using fluid restriction alone.
• After hyponatraemia symptoms have resolved, ensure that the rate of increase of plasma sodium 
does not exceed 12 mmol/l in a 24-hr period.
• Children with a symptomatic hyponatremia  do not require 3% sodium chloride treatment and if 
dehydrated may be managed with oral fluids or intravenous rehydration with 0.9% sodium chloride.
• Children who are hyponatremic and have a normal or raised volume status should be managed with 
fluid restriction to half or 2/3rd maintenance.
• For Hyponatraemia secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis ; refer DKA protocol.

Hypokalaemia
Treatment• The daily potassium requirement is 1-2mmol/kg/day.
• Normal values of potassium are:
• Birth - 2 weeks: 3.7 - 6.0mmol/l
• 2 weeks – 3 months: 3.7 - 5.7mmol/l
• 3 months and above: 3.5 - 5.0mmol/l
• Identify and treat the underlying condition.
• Unless symptomatic, a potassium level of 3.0-3.4 mmol/l is generally not supplemented  but rather 
monitored.
• The treatment of hypokalaemia will need to be individualized for each patient.
Oral Supplementation
• Oral Potassium chloride (KCL), to a maximum of 2 mmol/kg/day in divided doses is common 
but more may be required in practice.
Intravenous Supplementation (1gram KCL = 13.3 mmol KCL)
• Potassium chloride is always given by IV infusion, NEVER by bolus injection .
• Maximum concentration via a peripheral vein is 40 mmol/l  (concentrations of up to 60 
mmol/l can be used with specialist advice).
• Maximum infusion rate is 0.2mmol/kg/hour  (in non-ICU setting).
Intravenous Correction (1gram KCL = 13.3 mmol KCL)
• K+ < 2.5 mmol/L may be associated with significant cardiovascular compromise. In the 
emergency situation, an IV infusion KCL may be given
• Dose: initially 0.4 mmol/kg/hr into a central vein, until K+ level is restored.
• Ideally this should occur in an intensive care setting.• Hypokalaemia is defined as serum K+ < 3.4 mmol/l
(Treat if < 3.0mmol/l or clinically symptomatic and < 3.4 mmol/l)
• Causes are:
• Sepsis
• Gastrointestinal losses - diarrhoea, 
vomiting
• Iatrogenic- e.g. diuretic therapy, 
salbutamol, amphotericin B.
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Renal tubular acidosis
• Hypokalaemia is often seen with chloride 
depletion and metabolic alkalosis
• Refractory hypokalaemia may occur with 
hypomagnesaemia.ECG changes of Hypokalemia

Acute Gastroenteritis
Introduction
• Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality and an important 
cause of malnutrition.
• Many diarrhoeal deaths are caused by dehydration and electrolytes loss.
• Dehydration can be safely and effectively treated with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) but severe 
dehydration may require intravenous fluid therapy.
First assess the state of perfusion of the child.
Is the child in shock?
• Signs of shock include tachycardia, weak peripheral pulses, delayed capillary refill time >2 seconds, cold 
peripheries, depressed mental state with or without hypotension.
For any child with shock go straight to Treatment Plan C.
You can also use the WHO chart below to assess the degree of dehydration and then choose the treatment 
plan A, B or C, as needed.
Look  at child’s
general conditionWell, alert. Restless or

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 5         INTENSIVE CAREPLAN A: TREAT DIARRHOEA AT HOME
Counsel the caretaker on the 3 rules of home treatment:
Give Extra Fluid, Continue Feeding, When to return.
1. Give Extra Fluids (as much as the child will take)
• Tell the mother:
• Breastfeed frequently and for longer at each feed.
• If exclusively breastfed, give Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or cooled
• boiled water in addition to breastmilk.
• If the child is not exclusively breastfed, give one or more of the following:
ORS, food-based fluids (soup and rice water) or cooled boiled water.
• • It is especially important to give ORS at home when:
• The child has been treated with Plan B or Plan C during this visit.
• • Provide 8 sachets of ORS to be used at home with these advice:
• How to mix ORS.
• To give small sips from cup or spoon.
• If child vomits, wait for 10 minutes then continue but more slowly.
• Amount of ORS to be given in addition to the usual fluid intake:
• Up to 2 years     : 50 to 100ml after each loose stool.
• 2 years or more : 100 to 200ml after each loose stool.
• If weight is available, to give 10ml/kg of ORS after each loose stool
• • To continue to give extra fluid until diarrhoea stops.
2. Continue Feeding
• Breastfed infants should continue nursing on demand.
• Formula fed infants should continue their usual formula immediately on rehydration.
• Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formula are usually unnecessary.
• Children receiving semi-solid or solid foods should continue to receive their usual food during the 
illness.
• Foods high in simple sugar should be avoided as the increased osmotic load may worsen diarrhoea.
3. When to Return (to clinic/hospital)
• When the child:
• Is not able to drink or breastfeed or drinking poorly.
• Becomes sicker.
• Develops a fever.
• Has blood in stool.

Section 5         INTENSIVE CARE1. Use the child’s age only when you do not know the weight. The approximate amount of ORS required 
(in ml) can be calculated by multiplying the child’s weight (in kg) x 75.
2. If the patient wants more ORS than shown, give more.PLAN B: TREAT SOME DEHYDRATION WITH ORS
Give the recommended amount of ORS over 4-hour period:
Show the mother how to give ORS solution
• Give frequent small sips from cup or spoon.
• If the child vomits, wait 10 minutes, then continue but more slowly
(i.e. 1 spoonful every 2 - 3 minutes).
• Continue breastfeeding whenever the child wants.
After 4 hours
Reassess the child and classify the child for dehydration.
Select the appropriate plan to continue treatment (Plan A, B or C).
Begin feeding the child.
If the caretaker must leave before completing treatment
• Show him/her how to prepare ORS solution at home.
• Show him/her how much ORS to give to finish the 4-hour treatment at home.
• Provide enough ORS packets to complete rehydration. Also provide 8 additional packets as 
recommended in Plan A.
• Explain the 3 Rules of Home Treatment (Plan A):
1. GIVE EXTRA FLUID
2. CONTINUE FEEDING
3. WHEN TO RETURN.Determine the amount of ORS to be given in the first 4 hours.
Weight Up to 4 months 4 - 12 mths 12 mths - 2 yrs 2 - 5 yrs
Weight Less than 6 kg 6 to 10 kg 10-12 kg 12 to 19 kg
Volume 200-400 ml 400-700 ml 700-900 ml 900-1400 ml
Important!
• If possible, observe the child at least 6 hours after re-hydration to be sure the caretaker can maintain 
hydration giving the child ORS solution by mouth.
• If there is an outbreak of cholera in your area, give an appropriate oral antibiotic after the patient is 
alert.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 5         INTENSIVE CAREPLAN C: TREAT SEVERE DEHYDRATION QUICKLY
• Airway, Breathing and Circulation (ABCs) should be assessed and established quickly. Provide 
supplemental oxygen for all children in shock, and ventilatory support if the need arises.
• Start intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) fluid immediately. If patient can drink, give ORS by mouth 
while the drip is being set up.
• Initial fluids for resuscitation of shock: 10 ml/kg of 0.9% Normal Saline (NS) or Hartmann’s solution as a 
rapid IV bolus.
• Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and glucose should be obtained for all children 
needing IV fluid therapy.
• Repeat fluid boluses as needed, until the patient’s intravascular volume is restored adequately. Stop 
boluses if fluid overload is suspected.
• Observe the patient closely. Review patient during and after each bolus and consider other causes of 
shock if the child is not responding to fluid bolus, e.g. septicaemia, metabolic and cardiac disorders.
• Once shock is corrected, commence rehydration, provide maintenance fluids and replace ongoing 
losses.
• For rehydration use an isotonic solution, e.g. 0.9% NS or Hartmann’s solution. May consider 0.45% NS in 
neonates.
• Fluid deficit: Percentage dehydration X body weight in grams ( to be given over 12-24 hours ).
• Beware of hypernatraemic dehydration (serum sodium ≥ 150 mmol/L), and give fluid correction over a 
longer duration, e.g. over 48 - 72 hours, aiming to correct sodium gradually, ≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h.
• Maintenance fluid (See C hapter 9: Paediatric Fluid And Electrolyte Guidelines ).
Example:
A 12-kg child is clinically shocked and 10% dehydrated as a result of gastroenteritis.
Initial therapy: To establish ABCs.
• 10 ml/kg for shock = 12× 10 = 120 ml of 0.9% NS given as a rapid intravenous bolus. Repeat if necessary.
• Fluid for Rehydration/Fluid deficit: 10/100 x 12000 = 1200 ml
• Daily maintenance fluid = 1st 10 kg          100 × 10 = 1000 ml
                                                Subsequent 2 kg  2 x 50 = 100 ml
                                                Total                                = 1100 ml/day
• To rehydrate (1200 ml over 12 hours) 0.9% NS or Hartmann’s solution + maintenance (1100 ml over 24 
hours) with 0.9% NS D5%.
• Replace on going diarrhoea/vomiting losses orally whenever possible:
• ORS 5- 10ml/kg for each episode.
=== PAGE 92 ===

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
The cornerstone of management is to reassess the hydration status, vital signs and 
clinical condition frequently (e.g. at 1-2 hourly), and adjust the infusion and other 
support /therapies accordingly.
• Caution - more judicious fluid administration rate will be required in certain situations:
• Children less than 6 months age.
• Children with co-morbidities i.e. cardiac or renal diseases, severe anaemia, severe malnutrition (See 
Chapter 80 Approach To Severely Malnourished Children ).
• Children with severe hyponatraemia /hypernatraemia (See  Chapter 9 Paediatric Fluids and 
Electrolyte Guidelines ).
• Hypernatraemia should be suspected in a child if the degree of dehydration on clinical assessment is 
less severe than would have been expected from clinical history. However, this can be difficult to detect 
clinically.
• Serum electrolytes need to be checked from time to time to adjust the rate of rehydration and choice of 
fluid accordingly.
• Start giving more of the maintenance fluid as oral feeds e.g. ORS (about 5ml/kg/hour) as soon as the 
child can drink, usually after 3 to 4 hours for infants, and 1 to 2 hours for older children. This fluid 
should be administered frequently in small volumes.
• Generally normal feeds should be administered in addition to the rehydration fluid, particularly if the 
infant is breastfeeding.
• Once a child is able to feed and not vomiting, oral rehydration according to Plan A or B can be used, and 
the IV drip reduced gradually and stopped.
• If you are unable to gain IV or IO access, arrange for the child to be sent to the nearest centre that can 
do so immediately.
• Meanwhile as arrangements are made to send the child (or as you make further attempts to establish IV 
or IO access),
• Try to rehydrate the child with ORS orally (if the child can drink) or by nasogastric or orogastric tube. 
Give ORS 20 ml/kg/hour for 6 hours. Continue to give the ORS along the journey.
• Reassess the child every 1-2 hours.
• If there is repeated vomiting or increasing abdominal distension, give the fluid more slowly.
• Reassess the child after six hours, and classify dehydration.
• Then choose the most appropriate plan (A, B or C) to continue treatment.
• If there is an outbreak of cholera in your area, give an appropriate oral antibiotic after the patient is 
alert.

Role of nasogastric rehydration
Other indications for intravenous therapy
Indications for admission to Hospital• When oral rehydration is not feasible, enteral rehydration by the nasogastric (NG) route is the preferred 
method of rehydration, and should be proposed before IV rehydration.
• Enteral rehydration is associated with significantly fewer major adverse events and a shorter hospital 
stay than IV rehydration and is successful in most children.
• The rapid (40–50 mL/kg within 3–6 hours) and standard (24 hours) NG rehydration regimens are equally 
effective and either may be used.
• Unconscious child.
• Failed ORS treatment due to continuing rapid stool loss (>15-20ml/kg/hr).
• Failed ORS treatment due to frequent, severe vomiting, drinking poorly.
• Abdominal distension with paralytic ileus, usually caused by some antidiarrhoeal drugs (e.g. codeine, 
loperamide) and hypokalaemia
• Glucose malabsorption, indicated by marked increase in stool output and large amount of glucose in the 
stool when ORS solution is given (uncommon).
• Shock or severe dehydration.
• Failed ORS treatment and need for intravenous therapy.
• Concern for other possible illness or uncertainty of diagnosis in the presence of red flags:
• Vomiting without diarrhoea
• Infant under 6 months old
• Bilious vomiting
• Past gastrointestinal / surgical history (e.g. short gut, Hirschsprung’s disease, ileostomy) or complex 
medical history
• Signs of shock
• Presence of pallor, irritability, altered consciousness or activity level
• Abnormal abdominal examination e.g. focal abdominal tenderness, guarding, significant distension, 
absent or high-pitched bowel sounds.
• Caregivers not able to provide adequate care at home.
• Social or logistical concerns that may prevent return for evaluation if needed.
* Lower threshold for admitting children with obesity/undernutrition due to possibility of underestimating 
degree of dehydration.Section 5         INTENSIVE CARE

Section 5         INTENSIVE CAREOther problems associated with diarrhoea
Nutritional Strategies• Fever
• May be due to another infection or dehydration.
• Always search for the source of infection if there is fever, especially if it persists after the child is 
rehydrated.
• Seizures
• Consider:
- Febrile convulsion (assess for possible meningitis)
- Hypoglycaemia
- Hyper/hyponatraemia
• Lactose intolerance
• Usually in formula-fed babies less than 6 months old with infectious diarrhoea.
• Clinical features:
- Persistent loose/watery stool
- Abdominal distension
- Increased flatus
- Perianal excoriation
• Making the diagnosis: compatible history; check stool for reducing sugar (sensitivity of the test can 
be greatly increased by sending the liquid portion of the stool for analysis simply by inverting the 
diaper).
• Treatment: If diarrhoea is persistent and watery (over 7-10 days) and there is evidence of lactose 
intolerance, a lactose free formula (preferably cow’s milk based) may be given.
• Normal formula can usually be reintroduced after 3-4 weeks.
• Cow’s Milk Protein Allergy
• A known potentially serious complication following acute gastroenteritis.
• To be suspected when trial of lactose free formula fails in patients with protracted course of 
diarrhoea.
• Children suspected with this condition should be referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist for 
further assessment.
• Usually no necessity to withold feeding.
• Feeding fortification can be withheld temporarily until recovery.
• Undiluted vs diluted formula
• No dilution of formula is needed for children taking milk formula.
• Lactose free formula(cow’s milk-based or soy based)
• Not recommended routinely. Indicated only in children with lactose intolerance.
• Cow’s milk based lactose free formula is preferred.

Zinc supplementsPHARMACOLOGICAL AGENTS
• Antibiotics should not be used routinely.
• They are reliably helpful only in children with bloody diarrhoea, probable shigellosis, and suspected 
cholera with severe dehydration.
• Probiotics have been shown to reduce duration of diarrhoea in several randomized controlled trials. 
However, the effectiveness is very strain an dose specific. Therefore, only probiotic strain or strains with 
proven efficacy in appropriate doses can be used as an adjunct to standard therapy.• Not recommended, potentially harmful.
• Not recommended.• Racecadotril and Diosmectite (Smecta®, only in children >2 years old) has been shown to be safe 
and effective in reducing stool output and duration of diarrhoea. It can be used as an adjunct in the 
management of AGE. It acts by restoring integrity of damaged intestinal epithelium, and can also bind 
to selected bacterial pathogens and rotavirus.
• Other antidiarrhoeal agents like kaolin (silicates), loperamide (anti-motility) and diphenoxylate (anti  
motility) are not recommended.
• It was found that zinc supplements during an acute episode of diarrhoea may be of benefit in 
children aged 6 months or more in areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of 
malnutrition is high.
• In Malaysia, it is likely that zinc supplement is not indicated in majority of cases of children with acute 
diarrhoea.
• Dosage for age 6 months and above 20mg/day, for 10-14 days.

Section 5         INTENSIVE CAREChapter 11:
Sepsis and Septic Shock
• Sepsis
• is a clinical syndrome characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction  caused by a dysregulated 
host response to infection.
• Septic shock
• is sepsis with profound circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities  associated with a higher 
risk of mortality .
Key Points
• Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies hence early recognition by clinician is paramount. It is 
important to understand that vital signs are dynamic and require frequent assessment.
• Hypotension is a late sign, and shock can be present without hypotension. (see  Chapter 12 Hypotension 
in Children )
• Clinical signs can be unreliable in differentiating ‘warm’ versus ‘cold’ shock in children.
• Initial management includes securing intravenous /intraosseus access, obtaining blood culture, blood 
gas and lactate (if available), and early administration of empiric intravenous antibiotics.
• Fluid boluses should NOT be given in sepsis without signs of shock.
• Initial fluid resuscitation for septic shock should be with 10ml/kg boluses of balanced crystalloid, or if 
unavailable, 0.9% saline. Reassess child post fluid bolus, and consider additional boluses if needed.
• Inotropes should be considered if signs of shock persist after 40ml/kg fluids, or earlier if there are any 
concerns of fluid intolerance or overload.
• Central access is preferred, however if unavailable, it is safe to use peripheral intravenous line for 
inotropes and vasopressors during initial phase of resuscitation.
• Ideally blood cultures should be taken before antibiotic administration, but antibiotics must NOT be 
delayed (give as soon as possible, and within 1 hour of diagnosis in septic shock).If a child with suspected or proven infection has ≥2 of these clinical signs:
• Core temperature <36.0°C or >38.5°C (38.0°C if immunocompromised),
• Leucocyte count elevated or depressed for age,
• Inappropriate tachycardia and /or tachypnoea,
• Altered mental state (e.g. irritability /lethargy /floppiness),
• Reduced peripheral perfusion /prolonged capillary refill, he /she should be treated as having sepsis or 
septic shock, as defined above.

80 81
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 5         INTENSIVE CAREEmpirical Antibiotics : Give broad spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible.
• Age < 3months: Cefotaxime 50mg/kg and C-Penicillin 50 000u/kg.
• Age > 3months: Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg or Cefotaxime 50mg/kg.
• Oncology /immunocompromised patients: follow local hospital protocol.
• To tailor /de-escalate antibiotics accordingly once organism identified.
• Identify and control source of infection, e.g. drainage of abscess.
Inotropes/ vasopressors
• 1st line inotropes in septic shock should be adrenaline or noradrenaline.
• Target a Mean Arterial Pressure between the 5th and 50th centile for age.
• Adrenaline may be preferred in children with cold shock (low cardiac output, high systemic vascular 
resistance), whereas noradrenaline may be chosen in warm shock (high cardiac output, widened pulse 
pressure, low systemic vascular resistance).
• Echocardiography and haemodynamic monitoring should be used when available, to help guide choice 
and titration of inotropes.
• Dopamine is no longer recommended, but may be used if adrenaline and noradrenaline are not 
available.
• Inotrope administration via central or intraosseous route is preferred.
• Avoid concurrent administration of other IV medication when possible.
• For peripheral administration; adrenaline and noradrenaline should be in a more dilute concentration 
(e.g. 1ml/hr = 0.01mcg/kg/min).
• It is preferable to have invasive arterial BP monitoring.
• Dobutamine or milrinone (inodilators) may be considered in patients with evidence of persistent 
hypoperfusion and cardiac dysfunction despite other vasoactive agents, to improve coronary and 
systemic perfusion.
• Vasopressin may be considered in vasodilatory shock refractory to noradrenaline and adrenaline ( please 
consult Paediatric Intensivist ).

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 5         INTENSIVE CARERespiratory support  depends on the conscious state of the patient.
• For children with septic shock, ensure airway patency and give oxygen to improve tissue oxygen 
delivery, aim SpO 2 >94%.
• If normal conscious level: consider NIV (HFNC, CPAP or BIPAP).
• If abnormal conscious level or refractory shock: consider intubation and invasive ventilation, to reduce 
metabolic demand.
• Intubation: Caution during induction and to consider Ketamine for sedation, if available (as sedation 
may result in crash of blood pressure).
• Cardiovascular instability is less likely during intubation after appropriate resuscitation.
• Avoid etomidate in children with sepsis (risk of adrenal suppression).
• Consider starting inotropic support early prior to intubation.
• In children with sepsis and Paediatric ARDS, consider using moderately elevated PEEP (up to 10-15 
cmH20), controlled tidal volumes (4-8ml/kg) and keep Peak Inspiratory Pressure <32 cmH20 / Plateau 
Pressure <30 cmH 20. Titrate FiO 2 to achieve SpO 2 >94% (may need to accept lower SpO 2 in severe 
PARDS).
Further management
• Serial lactate levels may be used as a surrogate for tissue hypoperfusion and to guide resuscitation; 
aiming for serum lactate <2mmol/L.
• Maintain blood glucose between 4-10mmol/L. Avoid hypoglycaemia.

• Steroids may be considered in refractory septic shock, especially in children with suspected or 
confirmed adrenal insufficiency.
• For acute adrenocortical insufficiency, give IV hydrocortisone 2-4mg/kg STAT and QID, adjusted to 
clinical response. When stable, reduce over 4-5 days to oral maintenance dose.
• IV Clindamycin is recommended for toxic shock syndrome (TSS). IV Immunoglobulin may be beneficial, 
especially in streptococcal TSS.
• Bicarbonate therapy is not recommended for hypoperfusion induced lactic acidaemia with pH ≥ 7.15.
• Consider packed cell transfusion if Hb < 7g/dL. Children with symptomatic anaemia/ haemodynamic 
instability may need higher Hb targets.
• Routine prophylactic platelet and plasma transfusions in non-bleeding children with platelets > 20 x 103/
mm3 are NOT recommended.
• Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is recommended for haemodynamically unstable 
patients with AKI or fluid overload, who are unresponsive to fluid restriction and diuretic therapy.
• Therapeutic plasma exchange may be considered in children with sepsis and thrombocytopenia-
associated multiorgan failure (TAMOF).
• Stress ulcer prophylaxis is recommended for patients with high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding 
(multiorgan dysfunction, prolonged ventilation, treated with steroids /NSAIDs, coagulopathy, persistent 
shock).
• Early enteral nutrition within 48 hours reduces risk of GI bleeding, and is recommended for patients 
without contraindications to feeding, on stable or weaning doses of vasoactive agents.
• Routine Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is NOT recommended in critically ill children with 
sepsis or septic shock, but may be considered in children at high risk of DVT (e.g. obesity, adolescence,

• Definition of hypotension varies with population, age, weight and height.
• Multiple paediatric critical care guidelines define hypotension as either:
• SBP less than 60mmHg in term neonates
• SBP less than 70mmHg in infants 1-12 months of age
• less than the 5th percentile for age or
• less than 90/50 mmHg for children aged ≥10 years
• Clinical formulas for calculation of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) in 
normal children above 1 year of age are as follows (all values in mmHg):
• Comparison between normal population-based cut-offs including fifth percentile of systolic blood 
pressure (P5-SBP) in children and adolescents from the German Health Examination Survey for

weight, height and age.
• The PALS cut-off values for hypotension show good agreement with population data for children <12 
years of age, but may underestimate hypotension in children above 12 years old.
• Data on reference values for hypotension in critically ill children are extremely limited, and require 
further study.
• The clinically acceptable ranges defined above should be used in correlation with other markers of end 
organ perfusion, such as urine output, lactate levels and cerebral function, to determine appropriate 
blood pressure targets in critically ill children.

Principles of Transport of the Sick Newborn
Pre-transport Stabilization
• Transport is a significant stress and the infant may easily deteriorate during the journey. Hypothermia, 
hypotension and metabolic acidosis has a significant negative impact on the eventual outcome. 
• Procedures are difficult to do during the actual transport. Therefore, pre-transport stabilization is 
critical.Introduction
The availability of a neonatal transport system and its effective implementation has been shown to reduce 
the morbidity and mortality of newborns compared to minimal or non-existent transport services.
The principles of initial stabilization of the neonate
(see tables on following pages)
Airway 
Breathing
Circulation
Communication 
Drugs 
Documentation 
Environment 
Equipment 
Fluids – electrolytes, glucose 
Gastric decompressionMode of transport
The best mode of transfer is “in utero” . It is the best and safest option
The advantages and disadvantages of the different modes of transport (road/ air/ riverine) must be 
considered in each infant.
The principles of initial stabilization of the neonate
Airway
Establish a patent airway
Evaluate the need for oxygen, frequent suction (Oesophageal atresia) or an artificial airway (potential 
splinting of diaphragm).
Security of the airway – The endotracheal tubes (ETT) must be secured to prevent intra-transport 
dislodgement
Chest X-ray – to check position of the ETT
Blood gas analysis
=== PAGE 105 ===

88 89
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYBreathing
Assess the need for intra-transport ventilation . Indications of need for ventilation:
•  Requirement of FiO 2 ≥ 60% to maintain adequate oxygenation.
•  ABG – PaCO 2 > 60mmHg.
•  Tachypnoea and expected respiratory fatigue.
•  Recurrent apnoeic episodes.
•  Expected increased abdominal/bowel distension during air transport.
If there is a possibility that the infant needs mechanical ventilation during the transfer, it is safer to 
electively intubate and ventilate before transport.  
Check the position of the endotracheal tube before setting off.
If in doubt, the receiving surgeon/paediatrician should be consulted. 
If manual ventilation is to be performed throughout the journey, possible fatigue and the erratic nature 
of ventilation must be considered.
Circulation
Assess:
•  Heart rate, Urine output, 
•  Current weight compared to birth weight - are good indicators of hydration status of the newborn 
infant.
Also note that:
•  Minimum urine output should be 1-2 ml/kg /hr.
•  The infant can be catheterized or the nappies weighed (1g = 1 ml urine)
•  Ensure reliable intravenous access (at least 2 cannulae) before transport.
•  If the infant is dehydrated, the infant must be rehydrated before leaving
Communication
Good communication between referring doctor, transport team and neonatologist / paediatric surgeon  
aids proper pre-transfer stabilization, coordination, timing of transfer, and preparedness of receiving 
hospital.
•  Inform receiving specialist, emergency department of receiving hospital.
•  Provide name and telephone contact of referring doctor and hospital
•  Provide patient details
•  Give a clear history, physical findings, provisional diagnosis, investigations
•  Detail current management and status of the infant
•  Discuss mode of transport, expected departure time, arrival at referral centre
•  Decide on destination of the infant (e.g., A&E, NICU, Ward)
Drugs as required
•  Antibiotics – needed in most sick neonates
•  Analgesia or Sedation 
•  Inotropes
•  IV fluids
•  Pre-draw fluids, medication into syringes if required during the journey

Environment
Maintain a Neutral Thermal Environment
Optimal temperature for the neonate (axilla)  – 36.5 0C– 37.0 0C. Prevention of heat loss involves 
maintaining an optimal ambient temperature as well as covering the exposed surfaces.
•  Transport Incubator – would be ideal.
•  Wrap limbs of the infant with cotton, metal foil or plastic.
•  Do not forget a cotton-lined cap for the head.
•  Remove all wet linen as soon as possible.
•  Warm intravenous fluids.
•  ELBW newborn infants placed in polyethylene bags to prevent heat loss by evaporation.
•  Special Consideration: 
-  In Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy , therapeutic hypothermia  may be indicated. Please discuss with 
receiving neonatal team prior to transfer.
Equipment (see Table at end of chapter)
Check all equipment: completeness and function before leaving hospital.
•  Monitors- Cardiorespiratory monitor/ Pulse oximeter for transport.
If unavailable or affected by vibration, a stethoscope and a finger on the pulse and perfusion will be 
adequate.
•  Syringe and/or infusion pumps with adequately charged batteries
•  Intubation and ventilation equipment; 
•  Endotracheal tubes of varying sizes.
•  Oxygen tanks – ensure adequacy for the whole journey.
•  Suction apparatus, catheters and tubings.

• Transport Team . Ideally, there should be a specialized neonatal transport team. Otherwise, a neonatal-
trained doctor with/without a neonatal trained staff nurse should escort the infant. 
• A minimum of 2 escorts will be required for a ventilated/critically ill infant. The team should be familiar 
with resuscitation and care of a neonate.
• Safety of the team must be a priority.
• Monitoring . Regular monitoring of vital signs, oxygenation and perfusion of the infant should be 
performed.
• Fluids. Ensure that the intravenous fluids is monitored and infused according to the prescribed volume. 
Losses are replaced as required.

2. Gestational age classification:
• Early Term: 37 weeks 0 days - 38 weeks 6 days
• Full Term:  39 weeks 0 days - 40 weeks 6 days
• Late Term: 41 weeks 0 days - 41 weeks 6 days
• Post Term: 42 weeks 0 days and beyond
• Preterm: < 37 completed weeks
• Late Preterm: 34 weeks 0 days – 36 weeks 6 days
• Moderately Preterm: 32 weeks 0 days – 33 weeks 6 days
• Very Preterm: 28 weeks 0 days – 31 weeks 6 days
• Extremely Preterm: ≤ 27weeks 6 days
3. Birth Weight classification: 
• Low Birth Weight (LBW):  < 2500 g
• Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW): < 1500 g 
• Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW): < 1000 g 
• Small for Gestational Age:  < 10th centile of birth weight for age
• Appropriate for Gestational age: birth weight between the 10th and 90th centile for age
• Large for Gestational Age (LGA): > 90th centile of birth weight for age
Birth weight: 
 ÊPlot the birth weight, length and head circumference on the appropriate growth chart 
 ÊClassify birth weight into either AGA, SGA or LGA. 
 ÊIf the infant’s weight is <2.5kg - classify into LBW, VLBW or ELBW infant.
Current weight:
 ÊNote if there is weight loss (%) or weight gain (gm/kg/day).
 ÊA weight loss of up to 10% in the first 3–5 days for term and up to 15% in the first week for preterm 
infant is to be expected. 
 ÊLess weight loss is expected with the use of humidified incubators.
3. General condition:  note if the infant appears active, responsive to handling, having a good tone or 
whether the infant appears ill, lethargic and desaturates on handling.
4. Vital signs:  temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood 
glucose level.
• Temperature regulation
 ÊEnsure a neutral thermal environment for all infants (i.e. to maintain a core body temperature 
at rest between 36.5OC and 37.5OC). 
• Heart rate
 ÊTachycardia - rule out infection, pain, anemia, drugs or tachyarrhythmias.
 ÊBradycardia - primary cause is hypoxia. Other causes include hypothermia, electrolytes 
imbalance and bradyarrythmias.
• Blood pressure (*the estimated mean blood pressure for an infant is that of the gestational age at 
birth)
=== PAGE 111 ===

94 95
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYa. Hypotension 
 ÊIt is often indicating inadequate systemic blood flow
 ÊCauses include hypovolemia, abnormal peripheral vasoregulation (eg. sepsis) and myocardial 
dysfunction.
 ÊThe first line of treatment is volume administration. If the infant is hypotensive and there has been 
a history of volume loss at birth or risk of sepsis, administer normal saline bolus (limited to 10-20 
ml/kg). *Do not treat hypotension in preterm infants if the infant is otherwise stable, responsive 
and having a good tone. It is wise to observe first and repeat the measurement after 1 hour. Signs 
of hypoperfusion (poor peripheral pulses, rapid pulse, poor capillary refilling and cold peripheries) 
are not very reliable and specific to hypotension in preterm infants. Similar signs may also be a 
manifestation of hypothermia. 
- If hypotension persists despite volume correction, inotropic agents such as dopamine, dobutamine 
and adrenaline may be needed. In refractory hypotension, corticosteroids maybe considered.  
b. Hypertension
 ÊMay occur in up to 3% of NICU admission. 
 ÊIt is commonly due to renal or cardiovascular abnormalities such as renal artery stenosis, 
coarctation of aorta, polycystic kidney disease or thromboembolic renal artery or vein 
complications secondary to umbilical catheterization.
Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. 
 ÊLook for sign of respiratory distress (cyanosis, apnoea, tachypnoea, nasal flaring, chest recession or 
grunting) which may indicate the need for respiratory support.
 ÊTachypnoea while on ventilator may suggest inadequate ventilation.
 ÊOxygen desaturation with minimal or no sign of respiratory distress may be a manifestation of 
congenital heart disease.
Blood glucose level
a. Hypoglycaemia (*Refer chapter on Neonatal Hypoglycaemia) .
b. Hyperglycaemia.  
 ÊHyperglycaemia is less commonly encounter than hypoglycaemia among infants. It is more 
common in preterm compared to term infants.
 ÊAmong the causes of hyperglycaemia in infants include physiological stress causing an increase 
in stress hormones e.g. pain, hypoxia, respiratory distress or sepsis. Others include high glucose 
infusion rate or medication such as corticosteroids, caffein etc.Table 1: Temperature outside of normothermic range 
Infants with axillary temperature of < 36.5OC Infants with axillary temperature of > 37.5OC
• Consider sepsis
• Place infant under a prewarm radiant warmer 
or incubator (if infant is already in an incubator 
- check the incubator temperature and skin 
temperature probe)  
• Increase temperature by up to 0.5 degrees per 
hour until normothermia achieved
• Consider skin to skin
• Recheck temperature every 30 minutes until 
two consecutive readings are normothermic• Consider sepsis
• Assess environment
• Consider remove layers of clothing or blankets 
if overwrapping
• If infant is in an incubator or under radiant 
warmer, decrease the set temperature by 0.5OC 
every 30 minutes until normothermia achieved
• Recheck temperature every 30 minutes until 
two consecutive readings are ≤37.5OC.

 ÊCurrent evidence does not support routine use of sedation and paralyzing agents in preterm 
infants
 ÊParalysis has been shown to result in poorer lung function, more dependent oedema and longer 
duration of ventilation.
 ÊUse morphine, midazolam or fentanyl infusion as an analgesia and sedation if clinically indicated
• If infant deteriorates on ventilator, consider the following: 
 ÊWorsening of primary condition, e.g., RDS or congenital pneumonia
 ÊMechanical problem
 ͳETT dislodge or obstructed
 ͳETT displaced or too deep
 ͳPneumothorax
 ͳVentilator tube disconnected
 ͳVentilator malfunction
 ÊOverventilation of the lung
 ÊPneumonia such as nosocomial pneumonia
 ÊPDA or heart failure
 ÊPersistent pulmonary hypertension
 ÊPleural effusion
6. Skin care: A vital component of care especially for preterm infants.  
 ÊAvoid direct plastering onto skin and excessive punctures for blood taking and setting of infusion 
lines.
 ÊMeticulous attention must be given to avoid extravasation of infusion fluid and medication which 
can lead to phlebitis, ulceration and septicemia. 
 ÊGroup the blood taking together to minimize skin breaks/ breakage of indwelling arterial lines.
 ÊObserve limbs and buttocks prior to insertion of umbilical lines and at regular intervals afterwards 
to look for areas of pallor or poor perfusion due to vascular spasm.
7. Newborn Physical Examination
• Dysmorphism 
• Cardiovascular system.
 ÊAssess for peripheral pulses, more importantly femoral pulses.
 ÊLook for active precordium
 ÊListen for the presence of cardiac murmur.
• Abdominal examination
 ÊReview if there is any vomiting or feeding intolerance.
 ÊExamine for abdominal distension, presence of bowel sound or organomegaly.
 ÊExamine the genitalia and ensure anal patency.
 ÊMonitor bowel movement, urine output and for any high gastric aspirates.
• Central nervous system
 ÊExamine the anterior fontanelle for the size and tension as well as feel the sutures to look for 
overriding or separated sutures.
 ÊMeasure head circumference closely (every 1/2 - 1hourly) if indicated e.g. In infants with 
subaponeurotic haemorrhage.
 ÊAssess the sensorium, tone, movement, response to procedures (e.g. oral suctioning).
 ÊLook at the back/ spine for spina bifida.
 ÊThe presence or absence of seizures should also be noted.

 ÊIs there a possibility of infection? Is the infant on antibiotics?
 ÊFungal infection should be considered if the infant is a preterm infant who has been on several 
courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and on total parenteral nutrition.
 ÊConsider discontinuing antibiotics if the blood culture is negative and the infant improved “too 
quickly” after starting antibiotics, probably responding to other measures such as dehydration 
or inadequate ventilatory support.

• Input and output balance (ensure urine output is >1ml/kg/hr after the first day of life)
• Glucose level (Blood glucose)
• BUSE - correct imbalances after considering the underlying cause.
*Fluid and electrolyte therapy will be influenced by the infant’s underlying illness and complications 
and adjustments will have to be done based on this condition.

• Once infant is stabilized, use a pre-warmed transport incubator (if available).
• Continue CPAP or PPV during transfer, if needed, with adequate monitoring.
• Ensure thermoneutral temperature for infant. An incubator or radiant warmer is necessary for more 
premature and ill infants. 
Incubator Humidity
All infants < 30 weeks’ gestation should be nursed in an incubator with humidity1. Adequate Resuscitation 
• Resuscitation of the preterm is in accordance with the most recent Malaysian Neonatal 
Resuscitation Program (MyNRP). 
2. Thermoregulation
• Hypothermia can cause hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, cardiovascular 
instability and neurologic compromise.
• For infants < 32 weeks’ gestation, polyethylene plastic wrap or bag should be used to prevent 
hypothermia (without drying the infant) 
• Target admission temperature 36.5-37.5οC
3. Delayed cord clamping (DCC)
• Unless contraindicated, DCC for at least 30-60 s should be encouraged 
4. Respiratory
• In spontaneously breathing preterm infants, use early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)

Week Three -Four Discontinue incubator humidity 
when 40% is achieved 
Note: the duration and percentage of humidity may vary and depends on the infant’s gestational age, 
serum sodium levels, fluid balance and skin condition. Weaning humidity should only continue when 
clinically indicated as appropriate
After successful staged reductions, the infant’s skin should have keratinised fully at the end of this period
Immediate Care for Symptomatic infants 
Guidelines for the Use of Surfactant • Obtain Venous access (via UVC/PICC or peripheral vein) and Arterial access (via UAC or peripheral 
arterial line)
• Investigations are necessary as indicated and include:      
• Blood gases.    
• Blood glucose 
• Full blood count with differential WBC and IT ratio (if available)     
• Blood culture.      
• Chest X-ray (if respiratory signs and symptoms are present) 
• Start on 10% dextrose drip or Parenteral Nutrition as soon as possible (refer to PN chapter)• Maintain SpO₂ target between 90-95% in the VLBWs 
• Weight, head circumference (OFC), length measurements should be done on admission. Assess the 
gestational age with New Ballard score when stable 
• Monitor vital signs 
A. Clinical indications 
Surfactant replacement therapy should be considered in the following:
• Preterm infants with clinical and radiographic evidence of RDS or on respiratory support with 
oxygen requirement > 0.3-0.4 to maintain SpO 2 target.
=== PAGE 119 ===

102 103
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYB. Timing of therapy
• Prophylactic surfactant is no longer recommended
• For infants with worsening RDS, early rescue surfactant (within the first 2 hours of age) should be 
provided.
• Intubated preterm infants with RDS who are to be transported to a different neonatal unit should 
be given a dose a surfactant prior to transfer
C. Repeat Doses
• A repeat dose can be given 6 hours after the first dose if there is evidence of ongoing moderate to 
severe RDS and persistent oxygen requirements, FiO 2 > 0.3-0.4
D. Methods of administration 
• Endotracheal administration after intubation
• Intubation, surfactant administration and Extubation (INSURE) 
• Surfactant administration via a thin catheter 
 ͳLess invasive surfactant administration (LISA) method – a small catheter (usually a feeding tube) 
is placed in the trachea with a Magill forceps under direct laryngoscopy.
 ͳMinimally Invasive Surfactant Technique (MIST) method – a more rigid adult vascular catheter 
(e.g., angiocath 16G, length 13cm) is placed in the trachea (hence avoiding the use of Magill 
forceps
E. Potential complications and management  
• During administration, transient bradycardia, oxygen desaturation and ETT blockage can occur – 
temporarily stop surfactant administration, provide ventilation or oxygen as necessary, and resume 
administration after patient is stable.
• ETT obstruction – if suspected, observe saturations and chest wall movement. Re-intubate if 
obstruction is not alleviated and ventilation is impaired. 
• Pneumothorax – can occur due to sudden changes in pulmonary compliance if ventilation settings 
are not appropriately changed.
• Pulmonary hemorrhage – ensure adequate PEEP
F. Special considerations  
• Storage and handling: Surfactant is stored in a refrigerator at +2 to +80C. Surfactant should be slowly 
warmed to room temperature before administration. Gently turn vial upside-down to obtain a 
uniform suspension. DO NOT SHAKE. 
• Unopened, unused vials of surfactant that have been warmed to room temperature can be 
returned to the refrigerator within 24 hours for future use
Assess the need to start antibiotics (refer to Neonatal Sepsis chapter for preterm 
infants ≥35 weeks)
 Apnoea of prematurity ÊFor those infants< 35 weeks’ gestation consider clinical condition of the infant and risk benefit balance
 ÊCommon in infants born < 34 weeks’ gestation. 
 ÊConsider starting caffeine or aminophylline in those less than 32 weeks or with apnoea of prematurity

Enteral Feeding in Preterm and High-risk Infants
Introduction
Mother’s Own Milk (MOM)
Donor Human MilkTypes of milk for Newborn feeding
Human Milk Fortifier (HMF)• The goal of enteral nutrition is to meet nutrient needs and to achieve as near to normal weight gain and 
growth as possible. 
• Enteral feeding should be introduced as soon as possible. This means starting in the labour room itself 
for the well infant. 
• Mother’s own milk (MOM) is the milk of choice for all newborn infants. 
• Normal caloric requirements in: 
 ͳTerm infants: 110 kcal/kg/day 
 ͳPreterm infants: 115 – 140 kcal/kg/day
(Preterm infants who have had a more eventful course need up to 160 kcal/kg/day to have adequate weight 
gain)
MOM is the first choice as studies have shown that breast fed infants have lower risk for necrotizing 
enterocolitis (NEC), lower rates of late onset sepsis and had better neurodevelopment outcomes.
However, MOM alone does not meet the nutritional requirements of the very preterm infant as it has:
• Insufficient calories and protein for optimal early growth.
• Insufficient sodium to compensate for high renal sodium losses.
• Insufficient calcium and phosphate - predisposes to osteopenia of prematurity.
• Low in vitamins and iron relative to the needs of a preterm infant.
When MOM is not available, DHM is preferred over infant formula. 
DHM is associated with reduced NEC rates compared with infant formula.
DHM should be pasteurized.
As with MOM, DHM should be fortified with HMF to meet the nutritional requirements and achieve better 
growth.• Mother’s Own Milk (MOM) 
• Donor Human Milk (DHM)
• Term infant formula
• Term/ Preterm infant formula
• It is recommended to add HMF to MOM in infants <32 weeks or <1500 grams.
• HMF should be added to MOM when enteral feeding is at 50 - 100 ml/kg/day.
*Check the dilution as it may vary between different brands.

When to initiate feeding?
Rate of advancement?Minimal enteral nutrition (MEN)
Strategies of administering enteral feedingInfant formula should only be used when MOM and DHM are not available. 
There are 2 types of infant formula: Preterm formula and term formula.
Preterm formula maybe considered for very preterm (< 32 weeks’ gestation) or < 1500 grams infants
• As soon as possible for the well term infants and hemodynamically stable preterm infants 
• Generally, the rate of advancement is ~20 to 30 ml/kg/day.
• Implementation of standardized feeding protocol in each NICU has been shown to enhance nutrient 
intakes, improve growth and prevent preterm morbidities.
• Routine measurement of gastric residual volume is not recommended in the absence of other signs of 
feeding intolerance.
• IUGR babies with reversed end-diastolic flow on antenatal Doppler should advance slowly and 
preferentially start with MOM or DHM.
• Target feeding volume :
Aim to reach full enteral feeding (150–180mL/kg/day) 
a. ~ 2 weeks in babies weighing <1000 g at birth and
b. ~ 1 week in babies weighing 1000–1500 g 
• Target weight gain rates should be around 15-25g/kg/day.MEN or trophic feeding is recommended in preterm and high-risk infants.
The principle is to commence very low volume enteral feeds (< 25 ml/kg/day) on day 1 - 3 of life.
• MOM or DHM is the preferred type of milk.  
• For extremely low birth weight (ELBW), or growth-restricted infants, if by 24–48 h, MOM or DHM is not 
available, to consider formula milk.
Nasogastric vs Orogastric Route
• Both methods can be used as there is no preference between these two methods
Continuous vs. intermittent bolus feeding.
• There is inadequate evidence to determine whether bolus or continuous feeding is superior in clinically 
stable preterm infants.
• Intermittent bolus feeding is the preferred method. 
• Nutrients (fat and calcium) could be lost when feeding by continuous feeding.
• Continuous feeding may be useful in infants with underlying gastrointestinal disease.
2 hourly versus 3 hourly feeding
• There are no clinically important differences
Cup feeding
• If the infant can suckle and mother is not with the infant, cup feeding is preferable to bottle feeding to 
prevent nipple confusion.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYWhen to initiate oral feeding
When to stop HMF or Preterm Formula?
Vitamin and mineral supplementation• Coordination of sucking and swallowing usually develops around 32 -34 weeks postmenstrual age
• Oral feeding should be initiated when the infant show signs of readiness which typically occurs between 
32 – 34 weeks postmenstrual age.
• In preterm infants feeding difficulties can be due to:
a. ineffective suck and swallow mechanism
b. poor airway-digestive transit along the upper   gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
• Anticipate feeding difficulties in preterm infants with risks of suppressed respiration and delayed nipple 
feeding.
• Stop adding HMF to MOM or DHM when infants are breastfeeding on demand and have achieved good 
growth   
• Consider stopping preterm formula when infants are 35-37 weeks postmenstrual  age and have achieved 
good growth  
• Vitamins:  a premature infant’s daily breast milk/ breast milk substitute intake will not adequately supply 
the daily Vitamin D requirement. 
• Multivitamin drops providing Vitamin D 400 IU per day can be given after day 14 of life when reaching 
full feeding. 
• The supplement is continued for 3-4 months post discharge.
• Iron:  Premature infants have reduced intra-uterine iron stores and can become rapidly depleted of iron 
when active erythropoiesis resumes. 
• Therefore, infants of birth weight < 2000g should receive iron supplements. 
• Iron intake is given at a dose of 2-3 mg/kg elemental iron per day.
• Start on day 14, to continue until 3-4 months post discharge or until review.
* Infants who have received multiple blood transfusions may not require as much iron supplementation

Neonatal Hypoglycemia 
Introduction
Target Blood Glucose Level (BGL)
Screening Measurement of blood glucose• There is no single plasma glucose concentration or duration of hypoglycemia that can predict 
permanent neurologic injury in high-risk infants. 
• Neonatal blood glucose concentrations are usually lower in the first 48 hours of life during normal 
neonatal transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life. 
Clinical hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose concentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or 
signs of impaired brain function. 
• Target BGL for infants remains controversial but is commonly accepted as BGL ≥ 2.6 mmol/L in a term or 
preterm infant < 48 hours old 
• In term infants < 4 hours old, BGL > 1.5 mmol/L is acceptable if the infant is well, asymptomatic and 
tolerating feeds and repeat glucose is ≥ 2.6 mmol/L. 
• BGL < 1.5 mmol/L is considered severe, regardless of age
• For infants > 48 hours old, it is recommended to keep BGL ≥ 3.3 mmol/L to be above the threshold for 
neuroglycopenic symptoms 
• For infants with a persistent hypoglycemia or suspected of a congenital hypoglycemia disorder, to keep 
BGL ≥ 3.9 mmol/L. 
BGL should only be measured in infants with clinical signs of hypoglycemia, or who are known to be at risk 
of hypoglycemia.
Infants who are at increased risk of hypoglycemia and need glucose screening are:
• Large for gestational age (weight >90th percentile)
• Small for gestational age (weight <10th percentile) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
• Preterm infants < 37 weeks gestation
• Post-mature infants > 42 weeks’ gestation
• Infant of diabetic mother
• Perinatal stress: Birth asphyxia, maternal pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia, meconium aspiration syndrome, 
erythroblastosis fetalis, hypothermia, polycythemia
• Maternal use of beta-blocker
• Family history of a genetic form of hypoglycemia 
• Congenital syndromes (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedemann), abnormal physical features (e.g. midline facial 
malformations, microphallus)• Heel stick blood glucose (whole blood) – measured with glucometer (at point of care)
• Plasma blood glucose – performed in the laboratory (RBS). 
Plasma glucose values tend to be 10%-18% higher than whole blood values because of the higher water 
content of plasma.
Note: Blood glucose levels (BGL) can be measured using either method.

• Seizures      
• Apnoeic episodes     
• Tachypnoea 
• Weak or high-pitched cry
• Floppiness or lethargy
• Poor feeding
• Irritability
Note: Hypoglycemia may be asymptomatic therefore monitoring is important for all high-risk cases
• Well infants who are at risk: 
 ÊImmediate skin to skin with mother after birth and breastfeeding must be initiated within 1 hour of 
birth. If necessary, supplement feeding until breastfeeding is established. 
 ÊInitial BGL should be done 30 minutes after completion of the first feed.
 ÊSubsequent glucose monitoring must be done pre-feeds 3-6 hourly.
• Sick infants or unable to feed:
 ÊCheck BGL on admission and set up IV Dextrose 10% drip according to normal fluid requirement.
1. BGL < 1.5 mmol/L or < 2.6 mmol/L with symptoms:
• Assess and document any symptoms. 
• Need urgent treatment.
• Establish vascular access and confirm BGL in blood gas machine or laboratory (RBS).
• Give IV Dextrose 10% 2-3 ml/kg bolus.
• Followed by IV Dextrose 10% drip at 60-90 ml/kg/day (for day 1 of life)
• If the infant is already on IV Dextrose 10% drip, consider increasing the rate or the glucose infusion 
rate (GIR) (to achieve 6-8 mg/kg/min of glucose delivery)
• Repeat BGL 30 minutes after dextrose bolus.
2. BGL 1.5 - 2.5 mmol/L (within the first 4 hours of life) and asymptomatic  
• Supplement feed with expressed breast milk (EBM) or formula milk according to daily fluid 
requirement 
• Repeat BGL 30 minutes after completed feeding:
 ÊIf BGL < 1.5 mmol/L: Refer to (1) 
 ÊIf BGL 1.5 - 2.5 mmol/L: Consider another supplement feed and repeat BGL after 30 minutes.
 ÊIf BGL is below target level, to re-check BGL every 30 minutes. 
 ÊIf BGL not improving after 2 feeds, to consider starting IV Dextrose 10% infusion
 ÊOnce BGL is above target level for 2 subsequent feeding, to monitor 3-6 hourly pre-feed
 ÊStop monitoring once BGL stable for at least 24 hours
 ÊConsider using neonatal oral 40% Dextrose gel (if available) followed by oral feeding

• If hypoglycemia persists despite IV Dextrose 10% infusion, to check that IV infusion of dextrose is 
adequate and running well.
• Increase volume by 20-30 ml/kg/day and/ or increase dextrose concentration to 12.5% or 15%. 
• IV Dextrose concentrations of more than 12.5% must be infused through a central line.
• If hypoglycemia still persists despite GIR > 8-10 mg/kg/min, consider Glucagon 0.5-1 mg stat (IV, IM 
or subcutaneous) then 5-10 mcg/kg/hour as maintenance
• Glucagon is only useful where there are sufficient glycogen stores such as in infant of diabetic 
mother. 
• In high doses (>20mcg/kg/hour), glucagon can cause paradoxical insulin secretion and rebound 
hypoglycemia and should be avoided.
• If hypoglycemia occurs in neonates with poor glycogen stores as in IUGR and SGA infants, or in 
adrenal insufficiency, increase the GIR to 12mg/kg/min. If hypoglycaemia persists despite a glucose 
infusion rate (GIR) of > 12mg/kg/min, a short course (1-2 days) of IV hydrocortisone 1-2 mg/kg /
dose bd or tds may be considered. 
• Prolonged hydrocortisone is only beneficial in those with adrenal insufficiency. 
• A subset of IUGR/ SGA infants may have hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia (HH) with sufficient 
glycogen stores. 
To determine glucagon responsiveness, a glucagon challenge test should be done – IM/IV/
Subcutaneous 0.5mg or 1mg can be given, and if there is a rise of 1.7mmol/L after 10-15 mins, this 
implies there are sufficient glycogen stores and glucagon infusion can be continued.
• Hypoglycaemia persisting > 48 hours of life require further investigations* :
 ÊObtain “critical” sampling when BGL < 2.6 mmol/L after 48 hours of life 
 ÊPlasma glucose (RBS) 
 ÊBlood Gas 
 ÊSerum Lactate 
 ÊSerum Ammonia
 ÊSerum Ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate)

Section 6         NEONATOLOGYPearls and Pitfalls in Management 
• Depending on severity of hypoglycemia, maintain some oral feeds as milk has more calories than 10% 
dextrose.
• Breastfeeding should be encouraged as it is more ketogenic. 
• Feed infant with as much milk as tolerated and infuse glucose at a sufficient rate to prevent 
hypoglycemia. The dextrose infusion is then reduced slowly while milk feeds is maintained or increased. 
• Avoid giving multiple boluses of glucose as they can cause a rapid rise in blood glucose concentration in 
which may be harmful to neurological function and may be followed by rebound hypoglycaemia. 
• Any bolus given must be followed by a continuous infusion of glucose. There is no place for treatment 
with intermittent glucose boluses alone. 
• Ensure volume of IV fluid is appropriate for infants, taking into consideration concomitant problems 
like cardiac failure, cerebral oedema and renal failure. If unable to increase volume further, increase 
dextrose concentration.

Neonatal Encephalopathy and Hypothermia Therapy 
Introduction
Neonatal Encephalopathy (NE)  is a clinical defined syndrome of disturbed neurological function, manifested 
by a subnormal level of consciousness, difficulty in initiating and maintaining respiration, depression of 
muscle tone and reflexes and often seizures; in the earliest days of life of an infant born ≥ 35 weeks of 
gestation.
Moderate or severe NE occurs in 2/1000 live 
births; usually affects full term infants.
The terminology NE is preferred to Hypoxic 
Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) unless it is possible 
to document a significant hypoxic-ischemic insult 
in the peripartum or intrapartum period.
In a large Western Australian study, risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy were mainly seen in the 
antenatal period (69%) as compared to the intrapartum period (25%) and only 4% were due to intrapartum 
hypoxia. There is no definitive test or set of markers that accurately identifies, with high sensitivity and 
specificity, an infant in whom neonatal encephalopathy is attributable to an acute intrapartum event.
In neonates confirmed to have neonatal encephalopathy, assessment following the criteria listed in Table 1, 
will determine the likelihood of an acute peripartum/intrapartum event as a contributing factor, especially 
when more of the elements from each of the item categories in the table are met.Table 1 : Criteria suggestive of HIE in the newborn 
1. Early onset of moderate or severe encephalopathy in newborn ≥ 35 weeks gestational age. (If aEEG 
available – amplitude range- lower below 5, higher below 10, i.e. low amplitude aEEG, suggest more 
severe encephalopathy)
2. Neonatal signs consistent with an intrapartum or peripartum event:
• Arterial cord pH < 7.0, base deficit ≥ 12 mmol/L. 
• Apgar score of ≤ 5 at 5 and 10 minutes of life 
• Evidence of multiorgan system dysfunction within 72 hours of birth
• Neuroimaging evidence of acute brain injury seen on brain MRI consistent with hypoxia–ischemia 
Type and timing of contributing factors that are consistent with intrapartum timing 
• A sentinel hypoxic or ischemic event occurring immediately before or during labor and delivery
• Fetal heart rate pattern that becomes abnormal during labour or    after a sentinel event
3. The absence of an infectious cause, a congenital malformation of the brain, an inborn error of 
metabolism or other condition, which could explain the encephalopathy.Causes of Neonatal Encephalopathy
1. Hypoxic-ischaemic event
2. Central nervous system (CNS) malformations
3. Intracranial haemorrhage
4. Intracranial infection
5. Cerebral infarction/stroke
6. Metabolic disorders
7. Drug toxicity
8. Drug withdrawal
9. Electrolyte imbalances

• This is mainly used in term infants or infants > 35 weeks gestation. It is not useful in premature 
infants.
• Presence of seizures OR signs in at least 3 of the 6 categories in Table 2, in keeping with moderate/
severe encephalopathy, is used as a criteria for starting hypothermia therapy.
• If decision to start hypothermia therapy is yet to be determined, to monitor on an hourly basis, for 
6 hours, until decision to start is made.
2. Thompson Encephalopathy Score
• An alternative assessment using scoring system to monitor severity of encephalopathy
• To commence hypothermia therapy as soon as the Thompson score is ≥ 7 from birth to 6 hours, and 
the infant fulfils other criteria for hypothermia therapy.

• If using passive cooling method, apply skin probe and turn the radiant warmer on with the servo set 
at 34.5oC, and increase the set temperature by 0.5oC every 2 hours until 36.5oC and rectal temperature 
is 37oC. (Rewarming can occur too rapidly, so infants need close monitoring. If infant is rewarming too 
rapidly increase set temperature by 0.5°C every 4 hours instead and avoid hyperthermia)  
• Monitor infant’s temperature carefully for 24 hours after normothermia has been achieved to prevent 
rebound hyperthermia.
• Monitor closely for seizures, as this can happen during the rewarming phase, especially if done too 
rapidly.
• Sinus bradycardia 
• Decreased blood pressure 
• Increased oxygen requirement

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYTable 4: PASSIVE COOLING +/- ACTIVE COOLING WITH COOL PACKS
Passive cooling is a method of hypothermia therapy using environmental temperature to cool infant to 
target temperature.
Aims  
• To achieve body temperature 33.5oC - 34.5oC (axillary) or 33oC - 34oC (rectal) ( target temperature ) 
within 60 minutes of commencing cooling.
• To achieve hypothermia initially with passive cooling .
• If body temperature remains > 35.5oC (axillary) or > 35oC (rectal) within 60 minutes of starting, then 
active cooling  should be started.
• To keep infant in target temperature for 72 hours then rewarm slowly over 12 hours.
Procedure of passive cooling  
• Infant must be nursed on open warmer (NOT closed incubator) with warmer switched off.
• Nurse infant naked and unfasten diapers.
• Record time of commencement of passive cooling and rectal or axillary temperature every 15 
minutes ( refer flow chart ).
• If axillary temperature drops below 34°C (rectal temperature < 33.5°C), set radiant warmer on servo-
controlled mode at the lowest temperature to achieve target temperature.
Procedure of active cooling with cool packs
• Store cool packs in 4°C fridge (NOT freezer), when not in use.
• Cool packs must be wrapped in cotton bags when applied. They should never be applied directly to 
the skin.
• Place cool packs under the shoulders/upper back (under the head) and/or across the chest. Cool 
packs should not be placed at the axilla as it interferes with axillary temperature monitoring.
• Number of cool packs to be used depends on measured body temperature (refer Table 5).
• Aim to achieve target temperature within the first hour of cooling.
• Record the time of commencement of active cooling and monitor temperatures every 15 minutes 
(refer flow chart ).
• If rectal temp drops to <34oC (axillary temp <34.5oC), remove all cool packs and repeat temperature 
in 15 minutes. Then continue with passive cooling.

Section 6         NEONATOLOGYMONITORING OF NEONATE WITH NEONATAL ENCEPHALOPATHY
SUPPORTIVE MANAGEMENT OF NEONATE WITH NEONATAL 
ENCEPHALOPATHY• Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring; blood pressure (invasive blood pressure monitoring, if 
available), heart rate and rectal or axillary temperature monitoring.
• Amplitude – integrated EEG (aEEG) monitoring, if available. aEEG can be helpful in predicting outcome 
and identifying seizure activity ( refer Chapter 21: Neonatal seizures )
• Blood investigations ( refer table 6 )
1. Respiratory support:  Aim for normal oxygen saturations and normocarbia (using lowest ventilatory 
support as needed by neonate, especially if minimal or no concurrent respiratory disease).
2. Hypotension:  If infant has impaired tissue perfusion with low blood pressure, consider treatment with 
volume replacement and/or inotropes. Choice of therapy should be guided by possible aetiology and 
clinical assessment. In a hypovolemic state with history of blood loss (e.g. bleeding placenta previa, 
etc.), a fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg of normal saline may be given. Avoid multiple fluid boluses (unless 
volume loss) in view of possible impaired cardiac contractility, and renal impairment. Initiation and 
choice of inotropes/vasopressors should be guided by clinical assessment (e.g. dobutamine in the 
presence of reduced cardiac contractility).
3. Renal Impairment:  Total fluid management can be started at 60 ml/kg/day, but if evidence of renal 
impairment is present (with poor urine output and low sodium), total fluid may be reduced down to 
40 ml/kg/day, plus any measured losses. Careful monitoring for diuresis (following period of oliguria) 
is important, to guide fluid therapy and avoid hypovolemia. Medications with nephrotoxic side effects 
should be avoided or used with therapeutic drug monitoring.
4. Nutrition:  Trophic enteral feeding (10 – 20ml/kg/day) can be cautiously introduced once the initial 
biochemical and metabolic disturbance are corrected, usually after about 24 hours. Consider giving 
parenteral nutrition during the initial period. Normoglycemia should be maintained.
5. Sedative Therapy:  Signs of distress include tachycardia (heart rate consistently above 110 bpm in a 
neonate undergoing hypothermia therapy), facial grimacing and irritability. Ventilated infants may be 
given low dose morphine infusion (≤10mcg/kg/hour) and may be discontinued after 24-48 hours to 
reduce the risk of accumulation and toxicity.Blood investigation Frequency Comment

Chapter on Neonatal seizures ). Prophylactic antiepileptic medications should not be started.
7. IV access:  Neonates undergoing hypothermia therapy will usually have difficult IV insertions and blood 
taking, and therefore, requires umbilical arterial and venous catheters insertion.
8. Family support:  Parents should be engaged as soon as possible, and supported with clinical progress 
of the infant and explanation about medical therapies, including hypothermia therapy. If the 
infant exhibits impaired neurological function prior to discharge, parents should be involved in the 
rehabilitative therapies, including feeding and physiotherapy.

Neonatal Jaundice
Introduction
Causes of neonatal jaundice (NNJ)
Approach to an infant with jaundiceJaundice can be detected clinically when the level of bilirubin in the serum rises above 85μmol/l (5mg/dl).
• Haemolysis due to ABO or Rh-isoimmunization, 
G6PD deficiency, microspherocytosis, drugs.
• Physiological jaundice.
• Cephalohematoma, subaponeurotic 
haemorrhage.
• Polycythaemia.
• Sepsis, meningitis, urinary tract infection, intra-
uterine infection.
• Breastfeeding and breastmilk jaundice.
• Gastrointestinal tract obstruction: increase in 
enterohepatic circulation.
History
• Age of onset.
• Previous siblings with NNJ, kernicterus, neonatal 
death, G6PD deficiency.
• Mother’s blood group (from antenatal history).Risk factors for Significant Neonatal Jaundice
Prematurity
Down Syndrome
Jaundice in the first 24 hours of life
Mother with Blood group “O” or Rhesus negative
G6PD deficiency
Rapid rise of total serum bilirubin
Sepsis
Lactation failure in exclusive breastfeeding
High predischarge bilirubin level
Cephalohematoma or bruises
Infant of diabetic mother
Family history of severe NNJ in siblings
• Gestation: the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia increases with prematurity.
• Presence of abnormal symptoms such as apnoea, difficulty in feeding, feed intolerance and 
temperature instability.
Physical examination
• General condition, gestation and weight, signs of sepsis, hydration status.
• Signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) should be assessed for all babies with severe NNJ (see 
BIND score)
• Pallor, plethora, cephalohaematoma, subaponeurotic haemorrhage.
• Signs of intrauterine infection e.g., petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly.
• Cephalo-caudal progression of severity of jaundice.
The adequacy of breastfeeding, weight and hydration status of all infants should be assessed during the first 
week of life. Infants with weight loss > 7% should be referred for further evaluation and closely monitored 
for jaundice.

Management• Visual Assessment (Kramer’s rule)
• Transcutaneous Bilirubinometer (TcB) – 
 →TSB should be measured if TcB exceeds or is within 50μmol/l (3mg/dL) of the phototherapy 
threshold or if the TcB is ≥ 256μmol/l (15mg/dL).
 →TcB is not to be used for infants on phototherapy and not recommended for infants less than 
24hours of life.
 →TcB can be used for monitoring if it has been 24 hours since cessation of phototherapy. 
• Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB)
All newborn infants should be visually assessed for jaundice at every opportunity.
Indications for referral to hospital:
• Jaundice within 24 hours of life.
• Jaundice below umbilicus (corresponds to serum bilirubin 200-250 μmol/L).
• Jaundice extending to soles of feet: Urgent referral as it is a sign of severe NNJ .
• Family history of significant haemolytic disease or kernicterus.
• Any unwell infant with jaundice.
• Infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia should be referred to a hospital as soon as possible.
• Infants with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia can be investigated and referred only if 
the jaundice does not resolve or a definitive cause found.

Treatment• In infants with severe hyperbilirubinaemia, early-onset neonatal jaundice (<24 hours) or rapid rise of 
TSB (>8.5µmol/L/h or >0.5mg/dL/h), further evaluation may be required to ascertain underlying cause 
and extent of haemolysis. This may include: 
 ÊG6PD testing (if not screened)
 Êmother’s and infant’s blood groups
 Êdirect antiglobulin test (DAT)
 Êfull blood count (FBC) ± peripheral blood picture
 Êreticulocyte count
 Êseptic workup (if infection is suspected)
All infants should be screened for Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The result should 
be reviewed within 24 hours.
G6PD enzyme assays may be considered in infants suspected to have G6PD deficiency but with normal/
indeterminate Fluorescent Spot Test.
Use of sunlight exposure to reduce jaundice should be avoided due to risk of dehydration and sunburn.
Phototherapy
• Phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment in NNJ. Various devices are available to provide 
phototherapy such as fluorescent tubes, Light Emitting Diode (LED), fibreoptic and halogen bulbs.
• Effective phototherapy is achieved with optimal irradiance and adequately  exposed body surface area 
rather than the number of phototherapy units.
• Effective phototherapy consist of:
• blue light range (around 475nm)
• irradiance of minimum of 15µW/cm² /nm for conventional phototherapy
• irradiance of minimum of 30µW/cm² /nm for intensive phototherapy
• distance of the light source not exceeding 30 - 50 cm from the baby
• Irradiance of phototherapy units should be regularly checked.
• Phototherapy should be commenced when total serum bilirubin (TSB) reaches phototherapy threshold 
for neonatal jaundice.
• Overhead phototherapy is preferred to underneath phototherapy.
• LED phototherapy is preferred in preterm infants.
• Once the infant is on phototherapy, visual observation as a means of monitoring is unreliable. TSB levels 
must be obtained to guide the management.
• Escalation of care with preparation for possible exchange transfusion (ET) is required when the TSB is 
34µmol/l (2mg/dL) below the ET threshold.
Escalation of Care
• The current ET threshold (AAP 2022 guidelines) is higher as compared to previous guidelines
• Escalation of care refers to the intensive care that some infants with high TSB require to prevent the 
need for an ET and possibly prevent  kernicterus.
• Care should be escalated when an infant’s TSB reaches or exceeds the escalation-of-care threshold, 
defined as 2 mg/dL (34umol/L) below the ET threshold, as detailed in Figure 1
• Initiating escalation of care is a medical emergency and whenever possible, the infant should be 
admitted directly to the NICU rather than through the emergency department to avoid delaying care
• While preparing for possible ET, infants should receive intravenous hydration and intensive 
phototherapy.
• TSB should be measured every 2-3 hours until it is below the escalation of-care threshold.

• Vital signs should be regularly monitored including temperature and hydration status.
• Should be placed in supine position with adequate exposure.
• Eyes must be covered to prevent retinal damage.
• Breastfeeding should be continued.
• Turn off phototherapy and remove eye pads during feeding and blood taking.Figure 1: Approach to escalation of care. The escalation of care threshold is 2mg/dL (34umol/L)

Follow upAdditional notes• All infants discharged before 48 hours of life should be seen by a healthcare provider in an ambulatory 
setting or at home within 24 hours of discharge.
• For infants with severe jaundice admitted for treatment, early follow-up is needed to detect rebound 
jaundice after discharge.
• Predischarge screening should be used to prevent severe neonatal  jaundice (NNJ) in late preterm and 
term infants.
• Clinical risk factor assessment or/and predischarge bilirubin levels [TcB or TSB] can be used as 
predischarge screening.
• Universal predischarge bilirubin screening may be considered for all infants if resources are available.
• All G6PD deficient infants should be admitted and monitored for NNJ during the first five days of life. A 
TSB should be done if there is clinical jaundice.
• Term G6PD deficient infants with birth weights >2500g may be discharged earlier on day four of life if 
the TSB is <160μmol/L (9mg/dL) and followed-up closely.
• Infants with ABE should have long-term  follow-up to monitor for neurodevelopmental sequelae.
• Term and late preterm infants with TSB >20mg/dL (342μmol/L) or exchange transfusions should have 
Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) testing done within the first three months of life. If the ABR is 
abnormal, early referral to the audiologist for early intervention and neurodevelopmental follow-up 
should be continued.
• Healthy term and late preterm infants with non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia and TSB <25mg/dL 
(428μmol/L) may be followed-up at the primary care level.• Mothers who received Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIG) can have positive antibody screen for anti-Rh(D). 
RhIG can cause a positive DAT in infant but generally no hemolysis. Hence, if an infant’s DAT is positive 
only to anti-Rh(D) because the mother received RhIG antenatally and mother is not known to have 
Rh(D) antibodies prior to RhIG, the infant can be treated as DAT negative.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
• IVIG has been used to reduce the rate of haemolysis in infants with immune haemolytic disease. 
However, studies on its efficacy have been inconclusive.
•  IVIG 0.5 to 1g/kg over 2 hours may be given to infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease (i.e., DAT 
positive) whose TSB reaches or exceeds escalation of care threshold OR when TSB rise more than 
8.5μmol/L/hr.
• Dose can be repeated in 12hours if indicated.

Exchange Transfusion
Introduction
Indications
Preparation of infant
Type of Blood to be used.• Exchange transfusion (ET) is indicated for severe hyperbilirubinaemia.
• Kernicterus has 10% mortality and 70% long term morbidity.
• Mortality within 6 hours of ET ranged from zero death to 3 – 4 per 1000 exchanged term infants. 
• Causes of death include kernicterus itself, necrotizing enterocolitis, infection and procedure related 
events.
• Signed Informed Consent from parent.
• Ensure resuscitation equipment is ready and available.
• Stabilize and maintain temperature, pulse and respiration.
• Obtain peripheral venous access for maintenance IV fluids.
• Proper gentle restraint.
• Continue feeding the infant; omit only the LAST feed before ET.
• If < 4 hours from last feed, empty gastric contents by nasogastric (NG) aspiration before ET.
• Fresh Whole Blood (preferably irradiated), less than 5 days old OR if whole blood is unavailable, 
reconstitute Packed Red Blood Cells and FFP in a ratio of 3:1.
• Rh isoimmunisation: ABO compatible, Rh-negative blood.
• Other conditions: Crossmatch with infant and mother’s blood.
• In Emergencies if Blood type unknown (rarely): ‘O’ Rh-negative blood.Double volume exchange
• Blood exchange transfusion to lower serum bilirubin level and reduce the risk of brain damage 
associated with kernicterus.
• Hyperammonemia
• To remove bacterial toxins in septicaemia.
• To correct life-threatening electrolyte and fluid disorders in acute renal failure. 
Partial exchange transfusion
• To correct polycythemia with hyperviscosity.
• To correct severe anemia without hypovolaemia.

140 141
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYProcedure (Exchange Transfusion)
• Volume for double exchange is 2x circulating blood volume (Term infant: 2x 80ml/kg = 160ml/kg)
• Connect infant to a cardiac monitor.
• Take baseline observations (either via monitor or manually) and record down on the Neonatal Exchange 
Blood Transfusion Sheet.
• The following observations are recorded every 15 minutes: heart rate, respiration, oxygen saturation 
• Doctor performs the ET under aseptic technique using a gown and mask.
• Cannulate the umbilical vein to a depth of NOT > 5-7cm in a term infant for catheter tip to be proximal 
to the portal sinus (for push-pull technique ET through UVC). Refer to section on procedure for umbilical 
vein cannulation.
• Aliquot for removal and replacement – 5-6mls/kg (Not more than 5-8% of blood volume). 
 ÊMaximum volume per cycle – 20mls for term infants, not to exceed 5 ml/kg for ill or preterm 
infants. 
 ÊTo monitor vital signs closely – whether infant able to tolerate the aliquot per cycle. 
• At the same time, the nurse keeps a record of the amount of blood given or withdrawn. 
Isovolumetric or continuous technique
• Indication: where UVC cannulation is not possible e.g., umbilical sepsis, failed cannulation.
• Blood is replaced as a continuous infusion into a large peripheral vein while simultaneously removing 
small amount of blood from an arterial catheter at regular intervals, matching the rate of the infusion 
closely
 ÊE.g.: In a 1.5kg infant, total volume to be exchanged is 240mls.
 ÊDelivering 120mls an hour allowing 10 ml of blood to be removed every 5mins for 2 hours.
• Care and observation for good perfusion of the limb distal to the arterial catheter should be performed 
as per arterial line care
Points to note
• Warm blood with blood warmer OR Pre-warm blood to body temperature using a water bath.
• Avoid other methods, e.g., placing under radiant warmer, massaging between hands or placing under 
running hot water, to minimize preprocedural hemolysis of donor blood. 
• Shake blood bag gently every 5-10 cycles to prevent settling of red blood cells.
• Rate of exchange: 3 -4 minutes per cycle (1 minute ‘out’, 1 minute ‘in’, 1-2 minute ‘pause’ excluding 
time to discard blood and draw from blood bag).
• Syringe should be held vertical during infusion ‘in’ to prevent air embolism.
• Total exchange transfusion duration should be 90-120 minutes utilizing 30-35 cycles.
• Begin the exchange transfusion with an initial removal of blood, so that there is always a deficit to avoid 
cardiac overload.
• Routine administration of calcium gluconate is not recommended.
• Remove the UVC after procedure unless a second exchange transfusion is anticipated and there was 
difficulty inserting the UVC.
• Continue intensive phototherapy after the procedure.
• Repeat exchange transfusion may be required in 6 hours for infants with high rebound SB.
• Feed after 4 hours if infant is well and a repeat exchange transfusion is not required.
• If infant is anemic (pre-exchange Hb <12 g/dL) give an extra aliquot volume of blood (10mls/kg) at the 
end of exchange at a rate of 5mls/kg/hr after the exchange transfusion.
• Avoid administering any medication during the procedure

Vascular Spasm and Thrombosis
Definitions
• Vascular spasm  – transient, reversible arterial constriction, triggered by intravascular catheterization or 
arterial blood sampling. The clinical effects of vascular spasm usually last < 4 hours from onset, but the 
condition may be difficult to differentiate from the more serious TE. The diagnosis of vascular spasm 
may thus only be made retrospectively on documenting the transient nature of the ischemic changes 
and complete recovery of the circulation.
• Thrombosis  – complete/partial occlusion of arteries/veins by blood clot(s).Thromboembolism (TE) is being increasingly recognized as a significant complication of intravascular 
catheters in sick newborn infants. Many factors contribute to neonatal catheter-related thrombosis, 
including the small caliber of the vessel, endothelial damage, abnormal blood flow, design and site, duration 
of catheterization and composition of the infusate, in addition to the increased risk of thrombus formation 
in sick infants. Sepsis, prematurity and central catheters are the most common correlates of thrombosis in 
the NICU (J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med 2022).

Assessment
Management of vascular spasmClinical diagnosis
• Peripheral arterial thrombosis/ vasospasm – pallor or cyanosis of the involved extremity with 
diminished pulses or perfusion.
• Central venous line (CVL) associated venous thrombosis – CVL malfunction, superior vena cava (SVC) 
syndrome, chylothorax, swelling and livid discolouration of extremity.
• Aortic or renal artery thrombosis – systemic hypertension, haematuria, oliguria.
Diagnostic imaging
• Contrast angiography is the “gold standard”, but difficult to perform in critically ill neonates and requires 
infusion of radiocontrast material that may be hypertonic or cause undesired increase in vascular 
volume.
• Doppler ultrasonography – portable, non-invasive, useful to monitor progress over time. False positive 
and false negative results may occur, as compared to contrast angiography.
Additional diagnostic tests
• Obtain detailed family history in all cases of unusual or extensive TE.
• In the absence of predisposing risk factors for TE, consider investigations for thrombophilic disorders in 
severe and neonatal onset: anticardiolipin, antithrombin III, protein C, protein S deficiency.
• Immediate measures to be taken:
 ͳLay the affected limb in a horizontal position.
 ͳIf only one limb is affected, warm (using towel) the opposite unaffected limb to induce reflex 
vasodilatation of the affected  limb.
 ͳMaintain neutral thermal environment for the affected extremity, i.e., keep heat lamps away from 
the area.
• Inform the paediatrician immediately.
• Consider removing the catheter. If mild cyanosis of the fingers or toes is noted after insertion of 
an arterial catheter, but peripheral pulses are still palpable, a trial of reflex vasodilatation with close 
observation is reasonable – check continuously to see that the cyanosis is improving within a few 
minutes. A white or “blanched” appearing extremity is an indication for IMMEDIATE removal of the 
catheter .
• Other risk factors contributing to thrombosis include dehydration, sepsis, and polycythemia. These 
factors may need to be corrected immediately.
• Maintain good circulatory volume. If there is no immediate improvement with removal of catheter, 
consider giving volume expansion of 10 ml/kg of normal saline.
• Topical nitroglycerine – using patch or topical 2% ointment at a dose of 4 mm/kg body weight, applied 
as a thin film over the affected body area; may be repeated after 8 hours. Monitor for hypotension and 
be prepared to treat immediately.
•  If the limb ischaemia persists for > 1 hour without any improvement, refer urgently to the radiologist/
surgeon.
An urgent doppler ultrasound scan is needed to ascertain whether the limb ischemia is caused by 
vasospasm or thrombosis.

Management of catheter-related thromboembolism
• Management of vascular TE may involve one or more of the following: supportive care, anticoagulation, 
fibrinolytic therapy, surgical intervention.
• Treatment for neonates is highly individualized and is determined by the extent of thrombosis and the 
degree to which diminished perfusion to the affected extremity or organ affects function.
• Consultation with a paediatric haematologist, orthopaedic or vascular surgeon may be required.
• Initial management
• As for vascular spasm for peripheral arterial ischemia
• Removal of catheter as soon as blanching is seen.
• Supportive care – correct volume depletion, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia and 
thrombocytopenia; treat sepsis.
• Anticoagulant/ thrombolytic therapy
• The risk of serious bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy in neonates must be balanced 
against the possibility of organ or limb loss or death without appropriate treatment.  Data on the 
efficacy and safety of specific therapeutic agents in neonatal population are limited. (Chest 2012)
• Contraindications:
 ͳMajor surgery within the last 10 days.
 ͳMajor bleeding: intracranial, pulmonary, gastrointestinal.
 ͳPre-existing cerebral ischemic lesions.
 ͳInvasive procedures within 3 days
 ͳKnown history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia or allergy to heparin.
• Relative contraindications –
 ͳPlatelet count < 50 X109/L; (100 X109/L for ill neonates)
 ͳFibrinogen levels<100mg/dL
 ͳSevere coagulation factor deficiency
 ͳINR > 2
 ͳHypertension
Note: anticoagulation/thrombolytic therapy can be given after correcting these abnormalities.
• Precautions:
 ͳno arterial punctures
 ͳno subcutaneous or IM injections
 ͳno urinary catheterizations
 ͳavoid aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs
 ͳmonitor serial ultrasound scans for intracranial hemorrhageSection 6         NEONATOLOGY

• Standard or unfractionated heparin (UFH)
 ͳUFH should be limited to clinically significant thromboses with the goal of preventing clot 
expansion or embolism.
 ͳAnticoagulant, antithrombotic effect limited by low plasma levels of antithrombin in 
neonates. For dosage see Table below.
 ͳOptimal duration is unknown but therapy is usually given for 5-14 days
 ͳMonitor thrombus closely during and following treatment.
 ͳComplications: Bleeding (2% major hemorrhage rate), heparin- induced thrombocytopenia. 
Due to UFH short half-life, cessation of infusion usually resolves any bleeding. If not, correct 
any coagulation deficiencies
Antidote: Protamine sulphate if anti-factor Xa > 0.8 u/ml: 
 ͳsee Table on next page for dosage. One mg of protamine neutralizes 100U UFH
 ͳAnti- Factor X activity (if available) aimed at 0.35-0.7 U/mL.
 ͳBaseline aPTT is prolonged at birth and aPTT prolongation is not linear with heparin 
anticoagulant effect. Therefore, Anti-factor X activity more effectively monitors UFH use in 
newborn infants.

• Consider thrombolytic agents (r-tPA: recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the 
thrombolytic agent of choice as has better clot lysis in vitro and lower risk of hypersensitivity) if 
there is limb/life threatening thrombus 
• Decision for thrombolytic therapy in newborns ideally be made by multidisciplinary team with 
input from surgical and hematology specialist because of high risk of major bleeding. Parents or 
caregivers should be involved in the decision-making process and be fully informed about the 
therapeutic options and risks.
• Contraindications – related to increased risk of bleeding:
 ͳMajor surgery or hemorrhage within previous 10 days
Neurosurgery within 3 weeks
Severe asphyxia event within 7 days
Any invasive procedures within 3 days
Seizures within 48 hours
Prematurity < 32 weeks gestation
Septicemia
Active bleeding
Inability to maintain platelets > 100 x109/L or fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL
• Supplementation with plasminogen in the form of FFP is recommended to ensure adequate 
thrombolysis.
• Thrombi that have been present for several days may be resistant to thrombolysis with failure 
rates up to 50%
• Dosing tPA:
 ͳtPA 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/h (without loading) given over 6 hours. If response inadequate, can be 
repeated with an increase dose
 ͳAlternative regime of 24h infusion at initial dose of 0.03mg/kg/h with subsequent dose

 ͳMonitor fibrinogen levels, thrombin time and plasminogen levels, (if on UFH - coagulation 
profile) before starting, 4-6 hours after starting and 12-24 hourly thereafter.
 ͳImaging studies of thrombus before initiation, 4-6 hours after starting and every 12-24 
hours to allow discontinuation of treatment as soon as clot lysis is achieved.
 ͳMaintain fibrinogen >100-150mg/dL with cryoprecipitate (1U/5kg)

thereafter – minimum of 100 x109/L dependent on bleeding risk
 ͳCranial imaging before initiation and then daily
 ͳComplications: bleeding, embolization. Have compresses and localized thrombin available 
for localized bleeding.
• No IM injections, no arterial punctures, no urinary catheterization, no rectal temperature
• Alternative to thrombolytic therapy is surgical thrombectomy. This is rarely performed as the 
success of the procedure is limited by the small size of the blood vessel and clinical stability of 
the newborn with thrombosis.

Patent Ductus Arteriosus in the Preterm
Introduction
Clinical Features
Complications
DiagnosisGestational age is the most important determinant of the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The 
other risk factors for PDA are lack of antenatal steroids, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and need for 
ventilation.
• Wide pulse pressure / bounding pulses
• Systolic or continuous murmur
• Tachycardia
• Hyperactive precordium
• Apnoea
• Increased need for supplemental oxygen
• Increased work of breathing 
• Increased in ventilator requirements
• Radiological evidence of cardiomegaly / pulmonary oedema
The clinical signs lag behind the echocardiography diagnosis of haemodynamically significant PDA by nearly 
2 days.
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) / Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL)
• Pulmonary hemorrhage
• Renal impairment
• Necrotising enterocolitis
• Retinopathy of prematurity 
• Chronic lung disease
• If echocardiography service is available, confirm and evaluate the significance of PDA 
• Supportive PDA should be identified before commencement of pharmacological closure. The following 
supportive PDA should not be closed :
 ÊDuct dependent structural heart diseases
 ÊPersistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn 
 ÊRight ventricular dysfunction 
• Table 1 summarizes the echocardiography parameters to determine the haemodynamic significanc of 
PDA (HsPDA). 
 ÊTreatment is considered in moderate to severe haemodynamic significance 
• In addition to echocardiographic indices, the HsPDA should be interpreted by considering the 
gestational and chronological age and by assessing the vulnerability of organs at risk for over circulation 
(the lungs), or hypoperfusion (e.g., the brain, intestines, and kidneys).

Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn
Introduction
DiagnosisClassificationPersistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of the newborn is a syndrome of failed circulatory adaption at 
birth. It is characterized by
• Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) resulting in decrease pulmonary flow
• Right (R) to left (L) shunting of deoxygenated blood across the PFO and PDA result in differential 
cyanosis. Oxygen saturation in the lower limb is 5-10% lower than right upper limb.
• Labile hypoxaemia with marked change in oxygen saturation with minimal or no change in settings of 
ventilator due to changes in the volume of R to L shunt.
• PPHN is clinically suspected in near term or term infants who have variable oxygen saturation.
• Physical Examination - some of the infants may have signs of respiratory distress. Single loud second 
heart sound.
• Differential pre and post ductal oxygen saturation (between 5-10%). Lack of differential does not 
preclude PPHN.
• ABG – Hypoxaemia disproportional to degree of lung disease.
• 2D Echocardiography with colour flow doppler confirm diagnosis with right to left shunting at PFO and 
PDA.
• Hyperoxia test if no 2D Echo available: PaO 2>150 mmHg in FiO 2 100% for 5-10 min excludes most CHD. A 
PaO 2 < 150 mmHg doesn’t exclude congenital heart disease or PPHN.
• Chest x-ray – evidence of underlying parenchymal disease e.g. MAS, RDS, pneumonia. Oligaemic lung 
fields in idiopathic PPHN.
• FBC with differential to evaluate for high hematocrit level (polycythaemia) and risk of underlying 
infection.• Underdevelopment:  hypoplastic vasculature e.g., congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary 
hypoplasia in oligohydramnios secondary to renal disease or chronic leakage of amniotic fluid.
• Maldevelopment:  normal lung with remodeled pulmonary vasculature as in idiopathic PPHN, chronic 
fetal hypoxia
• Maladaptation:  parenchymal lung diseases e.g., Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS), Pneumonia/
sepsis, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), asphyxia
• Intrinsic Obstruction: polycythaemia with intravascular obstruction and increase PVR.
=== PAGE 171 ===

154 155
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 6         NEONATOLOGYDifferential Diagnosis
Management• Differentiating PPHN from cyanotic heart disease soon after admission is important.
• Preductal and postductal oxygen saturations of more than 5-10% or PaO2 differences of 10-20 mmHg 
between right upper limb and lower limbs helps to differentiate PPHN from structural heart disease.
• The diagnosis is confirmed with 2D Echocardiography which may not be available in all hospitals.
PPHN management involves restoration of the cardiopulmonary adaptation and to minimize ventilator- and 
oxygen-induced pulmonary injury.
This includes treatment of the underlying disease, maintenance of normal systemic BP , decrease pulmonary 
vascular resistance and ensure adequate tissue oxygenation.
• Supportive care 
• Maintain normothermia, correct metabolic and hematologic abnormalities e.g., hypoglycemia, 
hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, polycythaemia and acidosis. Antibiotics if clinically indicated.
• Ensure minimal handling and stimulation
• Provide sedation and analgesia as required to avoid agitation and asynchrony with ventilator, e.g., 
morphine infusion 10-20 mcg/kg/hr.
• In the event of systemic hypotension, a fluid bolus of 10ml/kg of normal saline can be given, 
followed by dopamine 5-10 mcg/kg/min or noradrenaline of 0.05 – 0.5mcg/kg/min. Higher doses 
of dopamine infusion can aggravate PVR disproportionately to systemic vascular resistance (SVR). 
There is some evidence that noradrenaline may selectively reduce PVR and increase SVR.
• Mechanical ventilation
• Avoid underinflation and overinflation of the lungs as this leads to increase in PVR
• Adopt “Gentle” ventilation strategies with optimal PEEP and relatively low PIP or tidal volume (TV) 
for adequate lung expansion. Aim is to limit volutrauma, barotrauma and atelectrauma.
• Consider HFOV if PIP > 28 and TV > 6ml/kg are required to maintain lung expansion and good gas 
exchange.
• Target PaO 2 55-80 mmHg, with permissive hypercapnia and pH 7.30-7.45. Avoid hyperoxaemia.
• Surfactant therapy may be considered in PPHN secondary to parenchymal lung disease - RDS, MAS and 
pneumonia (benefit is greatest for mild to moderate disease).
• Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO)
• Potent vasodilator which selectively dilates the pulmonary circulation without decreasing systemic 
B P.
• Indicated in neonates with PPHN with oxygenation index (OI)> 15-25. Start at 20 ppm. Response 
should be fairly rapid.
• Once a sustained response is seen, FiO 2 is gradually weaned to ≤ 60%. iNO can be weaned from 
here on by 5ppm every 4 hours (or as dictated by blood gas). There should be a sustained rise in 
PaO 2 of at least ≥ 60mmHg (pre- ductal SaO 2 ≥ 90%) in between weaning. Once iNO is 5 ppm, wean 
by 1 ppm every 4hours. Gradual weaning prevents rebound pulmonary vasoconstriction.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 6         NEONATOLOGY• Sildenafil
• Can be considered for the following indications for treatment of PPHN:
a. An adjuvant to iNO in NO-resistant PPHN or to facilitate weaning of iNO where weaning has 
been difficult or slow
b. Primary treatment of PPHN where iNO is not available or is contraindicated
• Its safety and effectiveness have not been established in large RCTs. Until further evidence is 
available, the initial dosing strategy would include initiating therapy with oral sildenafil at 0.5 mg/
kg/dose 6-hourly and if there is no response, increasing the dose up to a maximum of 2 mg/kg/
dose.
• Response time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours after oral administration. Duration of treatment 
is not yet well defined, and one approach is to taper off the medication after a clear response and 
improvement is seen in the infant. 
• The treatment should also be discontinued after 6-8 doses if there is no improvement. It should be 
reduced or stopped completely if hypotension develops despite inotropic support.
• Intravenous magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) can cause reduction of pulmonary artery pressures in animal 
studies. Only observational studies are available showing it can be helpful in infants. It is associated with 
systemic hypotension. In centers without iNO, MgSO 4may be used. A loading dose of 200 mg/kg MgSO 4 
is given intravenously over 20 minutes followed by continuous infusion at the rate of 20- 50mg/kg/h 
to obtain a serum magnesium level between 3 - 5.5 mmol/l. Inotropes may be  required to keep mean 
arterial blood pressure between 40-45 mmHg. Some of the studies commenced on dopamine 5-10mcg/
kg/min prior to starting magnesium therapy.
• Other agents: e.g., Milrinone, Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) are not recommended to be used without 
supervision and in consultation with a Neonatologist or Paediatric Cardiologist. It is advisable to have 
ECHO facilities readily available for guiding therapeutic decisions in these complex situations.
• ECMO is a supportive measure that allows the neonatal heart and lung to recover from the underlying 
disease in iNO resistant PPHN. It is not available in this country. Newer therapies – Superoxide 
dismutase, arginine, bosentan and citrulline are under investigation
• Nutritional support should not be overlooked in the overall management of the infant.
• Developmental outcomes – long term multidisciplinary follow up is necessary as PPHN is associated 
with neurodevelopmental, cognitive and hearing abnormalities.

Definition
Aetiology 
GonococcalDiagnosisConjunctivitis occurring in the first 28 days of life with clinical signs of erythema and oedema of the 
eyelids and palpebral conjunctiva, purulent eye discharge with one or more polymorphonuclear cell per oil 
immersion field on a Gram stained conjunctival smear.
Sexually transmitted bacteria ( Neisseria gonorrhoea, Chlamydia trachomatis ), non-sexually transmitted 
bacteria mainly from gastrointestinal tract and skin,  virus (adenovirus, herpes virus and enterovirus) and 
chemical. 
• Most important bacteria by its potential to damage vision. 
• Typically presents with profuse exudate and swelling of the eyelids  2 to 5 days after birth.
• Without treatment, the infection can extend from superficial epithelial layers into the subconjunctival 
connective tissue and the cornea, leading to ulceration, scarring, and visual impairment. 
• The infant should be hospitalized and observed for response to therapy and for disseminated disease 
(e.g. arthritis, sepsis, meningitis)  
• Presumptive treatment should be started after obtaining cultures in high risk group (e.g. mother with 
no prenatal care, history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), or substance abuse)
• Treatment: 
 ÊSystemic: Ceftriaxone 25-50mg/kg (max. 250 mg) IV or IM single dose, or Cefotaxime 100 mg/kg IV 
or IM single dose (preferred if premature or hyperbilirubinaemia present) 
 ÊThe eyes should be irrigated frequently with sterile normal saline until the discharge clears. Topical 
antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate.
 ÊDisseminated infections : Ceftriaxone 25-50mg/kg/day IV or IM in single daily dose for 7 days, or 
Cefotaxime 25mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for 7 days and  10-14 days for meningitis.
 ÊNote: Ceftriaxone is not recommended for use  in preterm infants, neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia and 
concurrent administration in calcium containing solutions
• For asymptomatic infants whose mothers have untreated gonococcal infection, treatment with a single 
dose of one of the following: Ceftriaxone 25-50mg/kg (max. 250 mg) IV or IM single dose, or Cefotaxime 
100 mg/kg IV or IM single dose or Ceftazidime 50mg/kg IV or IM single dose.  
• Preventive measure is the most effective by diagnosing and treat the infection in pregnant women.• Essentially a clinical diagnosis 
• Laboratory diagnosis to determine aetiology 
• Eye swab for Gram stain (fresh specimen to reach laboratory in 30 mins) 
• Gram stain of intracellular gram negative diplococci - high sensitivity and specificity for Neisseria 
gonorrhoea. 
• Eye swab for culture and sensitivity. 
• Conjunctival scraping for indirect fluorescent antibody identification for Chlamydia 
• Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) - gold standard for diagnosing Chlamydia (not available in

 ÊTopical therapy is not effective.
• Includes Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Haemophilus, E.coli, Klebsiella species and 
Pseudomonas. Most are hospital acquired conjunctivitis which can be treated with topical antibiotics 
except for Pseudomonas. 
• Ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Pseudomonas is rare but may cause corneal perforation, 
endophthalmitis and blindness. These infants need assessment by an ophthalmologist and require a

Perinatally Acquired Varicella and Postnatal exposure to 
Varicella infection
Introduction
• In maternal infection (onset of rash) within 7 days before and 7 days after delivery 17-30% develops 
neonatal varicella with lesions appearing 5-10 days of life. Mortality can be as high as 20% since these 
infants have not acquired maternal protecting antibodies. Cause of death is due to severe pulmonary 
disease or widespread necrotic lesions of viscera.
• When maternal varicella occurs 7-21 days before delivery, lesions typically appear in the first 4 days 
of life and prognosis is good with no associated mortality. The mild course is probably due to the 
production and transplacental passage of maternal antibodies that modify the course of illness in 
newborns.
• Infants born to mothers who develop varicella between 7 days before delivery or 7 days after delivery 
should receive as prophylaxis 
• Varicella Zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) 125 IU IM as soon as possible after delivery or within 
96 hours of initial exposure (to reduce the occurrence of complications and fatal outcomes). 
Attenuation of disease might still be achieved with administration of VariZIGTM up to 10 days after 
exposure.
• For infants born to mothers who develop varicella between 5 days before and 2 days post delivery, 
add IV acyclovir 15 mg/kg/dose over 1 hour every 8hrly (total 45 mg/kg/day) for 5 days.
• If Zoster immunoglobulin is not available give IV Immunoglobulin 400 mg/kg (this is less effective) 
AND IV Acyclovir 15 mg/kg/dose over 1 hour every 8hrly (total 45 mg /kg/day) for 5 days.
• On sending home, warn parents to look out for new vesicles or baby being unwell, for 28 days 
after exposure. If so, parents to bring the infant to the nearest hospital as soon as possible (62% of 
healthy such neonates given VZIG after birth)
• If vesicles develop, give Acyclovir 15 mg/kg/dose over 1 hour every 8hrly (total 30-45 mg /kg/day) for 
7-10 days.
• Women with varicella at time of delivery should be isolated from their newborns, breast-feeding is 
contraindicated. The newborn infant can receive expressed breast milk in the meantime and breast-
feeding commenced when all the mother’s lesions have crusted.
• Neonates with varicella lesions should be isolated from other infants but not from their mothers.
• It has been generally accepted that passive immunization of the neonate can modify the clinical course 
of neonatal varicella but it does not prevent the disease and, although decreased, the risk of death is 
not completely eliminated
• Infants whose mothers develop Zoster before or after delivery have maternal antibodies and they will 
not need VZIG.
• Recommend immunisation of family members who are not immune.

Section 6         NEONATOLOGYPostnatal exposure to varicella in the hospitalAssessing the significance of varicella exposure
• Give VZIG within 96 hours to those who have been exposed if they fit the following criteria: 
• All infants born at < 28 weeks gestation or who weighed < 1000g at birth irrespective of maternal 
history of chickenpox. This group has increased risk of severe varicella up to 6 weeks after birth.
• All preterm infants born at ≥28 weeks gestation whose mothers have not had chickenpox or whose 
status is unknown.
• Infants with significant non-maternal exposure to VZV within the first 7 days of their life if mother 
have never had varicella infection
• All immunocompromised infants such as those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, have 
malignant disease or are immunodeficient, severe underlying skin disorder.
• Note that infants who are more than 60 days old or has been given blood transfusion may be 
VZIG negative even though there is a positive history of maternal varicella – to counsel parents to 
observe for varicella lesions so infants can be treated early
• Monitor at risk infant up till end of incubation period i.e. 28 days post initial exposure. Non-
immunocompromised infant who can be monitored closely at home and have easy access to 
hospital, can be discharged earlier.
• Isolate infant who has varicella infection and susceptible infants who have been exposed to the 
virus. Treatment of symptomatic infants with acyclovir as above.
• Screen exposed, susceptible hospital staff for skin lesions, fever, headache and systemic symptoms. 
They are potentially infective 10-21 days after exposure and should be placed on sick leave 
immediately should any symptoms or skin lesion arise. If possible, they can also be reassigned 
during the incubation period to areas where the infants are not as susceptible or non-patient care 
areas.
Other notes
• In hospitals, airborne transmission of VZV has been demonstrated when varicella has occurred in 
susceptible persons who have had no direct contact with the index case-infant.
• Incubators are not positive pressure air flow & therefore do not provide isolation. Neonates may not be 
protected given that they are frequently open for nursing purposes.
•  All staff should preferably be screened, and susceptible staff vaccinated for varicella before 
commencing work in neonatal, oncology and ICU wards. If not, they should receive post exposure 
vaccination as soon as possible unless contraindications exist such as pregnancy. Post-exposure VZIG to 
be given to non-immune pregnant staff up to 10 days post initial exposure to prevent complications in 
the mother and may reduce the risk of fetal varicella syndrome.
• The use of VZIG following exposure does not necessarily prevent varicella and may prolong the 
incubation period by > 1 week and hence signs or symptoms should be observed for 28 days post 
exposure.
• VZIG is not presently recommended for healthy full-term infants who are exposed postnatally, even 
if their mothers have no history of varicella infection. To emphasise to parents to bring back early for 
treatment with acyclovir if any skin lesion appears within the next 3 weeks.• The index case could be the health care professional, a family member or a patient
• There should be close contact with the index case: 
• Maternal/neonatal contact.
• Contact between health care professional or family member and patient
• Contact in the same room, including large open wards, for 15 minutes or more.
• Face to face contact, as in conversation.

(Exposed Infants)
Introduction
1. Postnatal Management
2. Preterm and/or low birth weight infantsTable 1: Hepatitis B Newborn Prophylaxis Protocol
• Low birth weight and preterm newborn infants have decreased immune response  to Hepatitis B 
containing vaccines compared to full-term infants. 
• For low-birth-weight infants (<1800 g) and/or those born at <32 weeks’ gestation (irrespective of 
birth weight), it is recommended that the infants complete 4-doses Hepatitis B schedule vaccination 
(the birth dose is not considered part of the vaccination series)The risk of a child developing chronic HBV infection is about 90% when infected perinatally. In Malaysia, 
universal hepatitis B immunization of newborns has been implemented since 1989.  
*Do not count the birth dose as part of the vaccine series.
# High risk pregnant women who are identified as being at risk for HBV infection during pregnancy (e.g., having more than one sex 
partner during the previous 6 months, been evaluated, or treated for an STI, recent or current injection-drug use, or having had an 
HBsAg-positive sex partner)Maternal HBsAg status Recommendation
HBsAg ± HBeAg positive • Administer HBIG (Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin) 
• Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (birth dose) * within 12 
hours of birth. 
• If possible, both should be given at the same time but in separate 
thighs  using separate needles and syringes.
• Complete the 4-doses Hepatitis B vaccine series.
• (3 Hepatitis B-containing combination vaccine at ages 2, 3, and 5 
months with a booster at 18 months (according to the Malaysian 
National Immunization Programme)

Revaccination with an additional dose of monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine 
and receive PVST 1–2 months later. 
If repeated PVST still shows no response (anti-HBs remains <10 mIU/mL) 
the infant should receive two additional doses of monovalent Hepatitis B 
vaccine to complete the second series, followed by PVST 1–2 months after 
the final dose.
3a) Anti-HBs -Negative

  b) HBsAg - positiveInfant is infected with Hepatitis B.  
Consult with the Paediatric Gastroenterologist for appropriate 
management and follow-up. 
5. Breastfeeding Caution:
6. CounsellingBreastfeeding is not a contraindication for infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive. Mothers 
who were not treated with antivirals during pregnancy are encouraged to breastfeed if their newborns 
have received combined immunoprophylaxis composed of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine.  1. Do not test the infant before 9 months of age, to avoid detecting anti-HBs from the HBIG given at birth 
and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection.
2. Due to a decrease in antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), PVST should not be performed 
after 12 months of age
Counsel the mother regarding the necessity and importance of the following: 
1. How hepatitis B spreads and how to prevent spreading it. 
2. The need for and importance of her infant to complete the primary Hepatitis B vaccination program. 
3. Testing her infant between 9 and 12 months of age to make sure the infant is protected and has no 
infection. 
4. The need to get medical follow-up for herself and family members who may be HBV carriers.

Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia 
Introduction
Risk factors for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
Diagnosis
ManagementDiagnosis based on prospective NICHD Jensen 2019 studyBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is chronic lung disease that occurs in premature infants. Survivors with 
BPD have serious consequences ranging from chronic cardiopulmonary morbidity to growth failure and 
developmental delay. 
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia is a multifactorial disease affecting over 35% of extremely preterm infants
Inflammation is one of the key drivers in the pathogenesis of BPD. Interactions of many antenatal, 
intrapartum and postnatal risk factors induce ongoing inflammation and subsequent aberrant repair 
process in the preterm lungs.
Preterm <32 weeks gestational age with persistent parenchymal lung disease confirmed by radiography and 
at 36 weeks post menstrual age requires the following intervention
Prevention strategies 
a. Avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consider early CPAP use at delivery room for 
spontaneously breathing preterm infants
b. If invasive ventilation is required, to consider using volume targeted ventilation and early timely 
extubation to non-invasive respiratory support
c. Minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST)/Less Invasive Surfactant Administration (LISA) has been 
shown to reduce incidence of BPD.Prenatal risk factors Perinatal risk factors Postnatal risk factors

duration of ventilation and exposure to supplemental oxygen.
e. In preterm infants, target oxygen saturation between 90%-95% ranges
f. Postnatal Corticosteroids use
• Postnatal systemic corticosteroids therapy improves short term lung function and pulmonary 
outcome of infants with established BPD and reduces risk of BPD in high-risk preterm infants.
• Postnatal steroid therapy is used to prevent and treat BPD. Its use is associated with short and long-
term complications.
• To minimize the complications, late systemic use (>8 days) is recommended over early corticosteroids. 
• Current recommendations are that postnatal corticosteroids therapy should be reserved for preterm 
infants who are ventilator-dependent after the first 7-14 days of life and any course should be of low 
dose and of short duration to facilitate endotracheal extubation
• Suggested low dose dexamethasome regimen (DART) (total cumulative dose 0.89mg/kg)
• 75mcg/kg/dose 12 hourly for 3 days then
• 50mcg/kg/dose 12 hourly for 3 days then

Long Term Management of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
General MeasuresFor those with established BPD, the aim of management should be to decrease the risk of early childhood 
death, prevent cardiovascular disease, optimize growth and ensure appropriate neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.
a. Adequate nutrition for high energy needs in infants with BPD to ensure adequate lung growth and 
repair.
b. Consider fluid restriction at 150mls/kg/day with caloric-dense feeds to improve lung function and gas 
exchange. (Low evidence)
c. Immunization – following the national immunization schedule for Malaysia. Passive immunization 
e.g. Palivizumab or Nirsevimab should be considered for RSV prevention in infants born ≤28 weeks’ 
gestation with an established diagnosis of BPD. Consider annual Infuenza/Flu immunization for the high-
risk BPD cohort. 
d. Family counselling regarding awareness of environmental irritants, mainly secondary smoke inhalation 
and minimizing risk of infection. This is to minimize further lung damage.
e. Monitoring with lung imaging for those with severe BPD, severe respiratory symptoms and/or recurrent 
hospitalizations for respiratory morbidity.

Section 6         NEONATOLOGYOxygen supplementationPharmacological intervention
a. All infants with BPD and extreme preterm infants (<28 weeks’ gestation) should ideally have an 
overnight pulse oximetry monitoring prior to discharge, with or without oxygen
b. For infants with BPD, supplemental oxygen therapy is recommended to maintain a minimum mean SpO 2 
of 93%
c. All aspects of care need to be optimized prior to initiation of long-term oxygen therapy (consider airway 
problems, assess for pulmonary hypertension, manage reflux disease and nutritional requirements, as 
well as complete repair of inguinal hernia by 36 weeks).
d. Home oxygen therapy will require a multi-disciplinary team approach, with a referral to the Paediatric 
Respiratory team. Four aspects to be considered are:
• The infant needs to be fit for discharge
• A dedicated caretaker for the infant
• Suitable and safe home 
• Availability of equipment.
e. Follow-up should be arranged in an ambulatory setting to facilitate patient care.
The clinical course in infants with BPD is complex, with multiple morbidities, frequent hospitalizations 
and often poor continuity of care. The formation of multi-disciplinary care has the potential to improve 
outcomes and survival in these infants.a. Bronchodilators can be considered if there are features of airway hyperreactivity. Routine use is not 
recommended unless there is clinical evidence of acute bronchoconstriction from acute pulmonary 
decompensation and needs to be weaned off as soon as no long-term benefit is seen. Be aware of the 
malacic airway in this group of infants.
b. Inhaled corticosteroids can be considered in subgroups with severe BPD, severe respiratory symptoms, 
recurrent hospitalization due to respiratory morbidity and symptoms not controlled with regular use 
of bronchodilators. Clinical effects should be closely monitored during a trial period and discontinued 
when no positive impact or benefit is seen.f. Acute episodes of pulmonary decompensation, in the form of exacerbations should be managed 
based upon the underlying aetiology (infections, severe airway reactivity, pulmonary oedema, 
tracheobronchomalacia, etc.)
g. Assess for complications of BPD, including monitoring for pulmonary hypertension, systemic 
hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac dysfunction, growth failure and neurodevelopmental 
impairment.

Non- invasive Ventilation in Preterm Infants
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
Biphasic CPAP, Bilevel CPAP, Duo PAP • CPAP is an established mode of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for infants.
• Clinical benefits:  improves oxygenation, maintains functional residual capacity (FRC), decreases apnea, 
reduces work of breathing and splints the upper airways.
• Limitations and risk:  nasal trauma, air leak syndromes, gastric distension (“CPAP belly”)
• Clinical indications:  
a. Primary mode of respiratory support - as first line respiratory support for preterm infants. It can be 
used shortly after birth in spontaneous breathing preterm infants as prophylactic or early CPAP to 
prevent intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV).
b. Post-extubation respiratory support 
c. Treatment of apnea of prematurity
• Clinical management:
a. Optimum CPAP pressure is not known and depends on the underlying pathophysiology and severity 
of illness.
b. CPAP pressures are generally set between 5-8 cm H 2O. Higher CPAP pressures can be associated 
with air leaks.
c. Starting at a pressure 5-6 cm H 2O and increasing by 1 cm H2O increments, adjusting based on O2 
requirements and clinical assessment of work of breathing (WOB)
d. Short binasal prongs and nasal mask are recommended over single or nasopharyngeal prongs.
e. Various types of devices may be used to deliver CPAP -no definitive evidence to suggest which CPAP 
device is superior. 
f. It is more important for the clinical team to be familiar with the devices available and their 
management.
g. The evidence regarding the optimum method of weaning is unclear. Gradual weaning of pressure 
has higher chance of success compared to sudden stopping of CPAP (sudden wean).
• Flow drivers are used to deliver alternating cycles of low pressure and high-pressure at pre-specified 
intervals 
• The high pressures (PIP) used vary between devices and generally range between 9 - 11cm H 2O. The 
high and low pressures difference is ≤ 4 cm H 2O
• The inspiratory time (IT) is longer (0.5–1 s) and respiratory rates are lower at 20-40/min.

Section 6         NEONATOLOGYNasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)
Heated Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula (HHHFNC)• NIPPV provides two levels of pressure: 
a. A constant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and 
b. A higher positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) without an endotracheal tube. 
• Set PIP typically in the range of 15 - 22cm H 2O. 
• The rate and IT for the PIP is set, making this a time-cycled pressure limited mode of NIV, mimicking 
invasive mechanical ventilation.
• NIPPV can be synchronized (S-NIPPV) or non-synchronized (NS-NIPPV). Synchronized NIPPV is preferred 
to non-synchronized NIPPV.
• Most of the conventional mechanical ventilator can deliver NS-NIPPV
• S-NIPPV can be delivered by some ventilators with specific triggering devices.
• Clinical indications of Biphasic CPAP, Bilevel CPAP, Duo PAP and NIPPV: 
a. Primary mode of respiratory support in situations where higher mean airway pressure than CPAP 
may be required.
b. Post extubation respiratory support 
c. Treatment of apnea of prematurity
• HHHFNC uses smaller binasal prongs (cannula) than CPAP , with a simpler interface, and delivers heated, 
humidified gas at flows of more than 1 L/min.
• Typical flows between 2-8L/min is used. 
• The pharyngeal distending pressure is not monitored and dependent on multiple factors: flow rate, size 
of nasal cannula, leak, airway anatomy, and weight of the infants.
• Do not occlude the nostrils and the preferred cannula to nares ratio ~ 0.5.
• Limited data on its use in extremely preterm infants < 28 weeks’ gestational age or term infants
• Clinical benefits: less nasal trauma, reduced pneumothorax, more comfortable for the neonate and 
parent and nursing staff preference
• Clinical indications:
a. Primary mode of respiratory support is associated with a higher rate of treatment failure compared 
with CPAP and is not recommended.
For clinicians and units who wish to use as primary respiratory support, it is recommended that its 
use is limited to infants ≥ 30 weeks’ gestation and FiO 2 30% on admission.*
b. Post-extubation respiratory support in infants ≥ 28 weeks’ gestation.* 
*CPAP should be available as a ‘rescue therapy’ to avoid intubation and MV in the event of failure.
c. Apnea of prematurity - There is insufficient evidence to recommend its use 
d. ‘Weaning’ from CPAP . There is insufficient evidence to recommend its use. However, given its 
benefits, it may be an alternative in those infants with  nasal trauma from CPAP .
• Clinical management
a. Start at gas flow 4-6L /min. Choice of starting gas flow should consider the gestational age, disease 
pathophysiology and current clinical status (O 2 requirement and work of breathing)
b. Consider escalating to CPAP if FiO 2 consistently > 0.4, continues to have increased work of 
breathing, increase rates of apnea or bradycardia.
c. There is no consensus on how to wean HHHFNC. Consider weaning FiO 2 to < 0.3 before weaning 
flow.

Asthma
Definition
Diagnosis of asthma in children younger than 5 years old• Asthma is a heterogenous disease with many phenotypes
• It is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, leading to variable/recurrent respiratory symptoms 
(such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough) AND variable expiratory airflow 
limitation.
• Evidence of  variable expiratory airflow limitation is demonstrated by:
• Low FEV1/FVC ratio (at least once during diagnostic process) 
• Significant bronchodilator response/reversibility: > 12% improvement in FEV1 in children < 12 
years old (> 12% AND > 200 ml improvement in > 12 years old) in response to administration of a 
bronchodilator PEF improvement 
 ͳPEF improvement >15% post bronchodilator can be used if spirometry is not available.
• Average diurnal variability >15% in children
• > 12% improvement in FEV1 from baseline in children after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory asthma 
treatment (>12% AND > 200 ml improvement in > 12 years old).
• Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) is an invasive biomarker of airway inflammation; thus, it helps to 
establish asthma diagnosis and monitor effectiveness of asthma medication (if the test is available).
• Whenever possible, try to document evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting controller 
treatment (it is more difficult to confirm diagnosis afterwards)The prevalence of asthma in Malaysian children (up to 18 years old) is 7.1% based on the Third National 
Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS III) in 2006.
A diagnosis of asthma in young children is often challenging as cough and wheeze are common symptoms 
either due to preschool wheezing disorders (i.e., viral-induced wheeze or multi-triggered wheeze) or acute 
bronchiolitis.
The diagnosis is mainly based on symptoms patterns combined with a careful clinical history and physical 
findings. 
A structured clinical assessment to assess the probability of asthma should be based on: 
A history of recurrent episodes of symptoms (symptoms of wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest 
tightness that vary over time, usually precipitated by allergens, exercise, environmental triggers (e.g., 
tobacco smoke, dust, air pollutants) or respiratory infections. The variation of symptoms may occur 
spontaneously or with usage of β2 agonist bronchodilator and ideally demonstrated by variable peak flow 
measurement, if feasible.
• Recorded observation of wheeze heard by a healthcare professional
• Personal/family history of other atopic conditions (atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis) or asthma in first 
degree relative
• No other features to suggest alternative diagnoses

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 7         RESPIRATORYA probability-based approach  (Table 1), based on the pattern of symptoms during and between viral 
respiratory infections may be helpful in the diagnosis, allowing individual decisions to be made about 
whether to give a  trial of controller treatment.
Table 1: Probability-based Approach of Asthma
Some Pointers:
1. For high probability of asthma, a therapeutic trial of low to moderate dose ICS for at least 6 weeks  may 
be commenced and clinical improvement with preventer treatment and worsening of symptoms when 
treatment is stopped is suggestive of asthma.
2. For low probability of asthma, evaluate for other diagnosis.
3. For intermediate probability of asthma, watchful waiting or a diagnostic trial of low dose of ICS for 3 
months and assess response.Clinical History Physical Examination

medications side-effects.
Good asthma control can be achieved through careful assessment, adjustment of medications and review of 
treatment response.
Treatment is individualised, taking into account patient’s own goals and preference. 
Partnership and effective communication skills are important part of management of any chronic diseases.
Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended preventer drug for asthma treatment. 
Newly diagnosed patients should be properly evaluated as to their degree of asthma severity or underlying 
background asthma (Table 3) and treatment should be started at the most appropriate step to the initial 
severity (Table 4 & 5) A positive family history of allergic disease or the presence of atopy/allergic sensitisation in the child with 
recurrent wheeze may predict the likelihood of evolving into atopic asthma and its risk may be determined 
by the modified Asthma Predictive Index (mAPI) (Table 2).

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 7         RESPIRATORYThe new paradigm in the latest GINA 2022  is to use ICS whenever SABA is taken (preferred) even in Step 1 
for children < 12 years old. For adolescents (≥ 12 years), it’s recommended to use as needed ICS-formoterol 
(preferred) or alternatively use ICS whenever SABA is taken or use regular low dose ICS, with as needed 
SABA (Table 4, 5 and 6). SABA alone is not recommended in this age group, as it increases the risk of severe 
asthma exacerbations. 
The choice of preventer/controller is very much depending on cost, availability, expertise, preference of the 
physician and parental acceptance to ensure compliance.
Step up treatment is indicated when control cannot be achieved at the current treatment level despite 
good compliance/adherence, correct inhaler technique, minimising exposure to precipitating factors, and 
treatment of co-morbidities and psychosocial factors, provided the asthma diagnosis is correct.
Step down treatment shall be considered when asthma control is achieved for at least 3 months with 
gradual reduction of ICS to the minimum dose required to maintain asthma control.Category Clinical Parameters

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 7         RESPIRATORYDrug Therapy and Delivery Devices
Monitoring of Asthma Control (Review Response and Adjust Treatment) and 
Risk Factors for Poor OutcomesIn young children, an MDI and spacer is the preferred method of delivery of β2 agonists and inhaled 
corticosteroids.
Patient should be reviewed 1-3 months after starting treatment, then 3-6 monthly thereafter. Asthma 
assessment after initiation of treatment is based on levels of Asthma Symptoms Control (Table 7: symptoms 
control over 4 weeks) as well as risk factors for poor outcomes (Table 8), i.e., risks for future asthma 
exacerbation and persistent airflow limitation, and medication side effects.
During each follow up visit, these issues need to be assessed. They are:
• Assessment of asthma control based on (Table 9):
• Interval symptoms (daytime symptoms, nocturnal symptoms causing night awakening, frequency of 
usage of rescue medication and exercise limitation).
• ACT or cACT (childhood Asthma Control Test) or ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire) can be used to 
assess symptoms control.
• Frequency and severity of acute exacerbation.
• Morbidity secondary to asthma.
• Quality of life.
• Lung function - spirometry (FEV1) or Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is a useful indicator of future risk. 
Ideally it is measured at diagnosis, 3-6 monthly after starting treatment and monitored periodically 1-2 
yearly thereafter (more frequent in severe or uncontrolled asthma).Drug Therapy: Delivery systems available & recommendation for different ages.

5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
• Acute exacerbations are episodes characterised by progressive worsening symptoms of shortness of 
breath, cough, wheezing and chest tightness, or combination of these symptoms and characterised by 
progressive decrease in lung function.
• Objective measurements of lung function (spirometry or PEF) are more reliable indicators of severity 
than symptoms (for those who can perform).
• Exacerbations may occur in a patient with pre-existing asthma diagnosis or occasionally, as the first 
presentation of asthma.
• Asthma exacerbations require prompt treatment.
• Severe exacerbations can be life threatening and can occur in patients even with mild or controlled 
asthma.
• Patients at high risk of asthma-related death require special attention, which include intensive 
education, monitoring, and care advised to seek medical care early during an exacerbation.
• Mild attacks can be usually treated at home if the patient is prepared and has a personal asthma action 
plan. 
• Moderate and severe attacks require clinic or hospital attendance.
• A patient who has brittle asthma, previous ICU admissions for asthma or with parents who are either 
uncomfortable or judged unable to care for the child with an acute exacerbation should be admitted to 
hospital.MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATION
Section 7         RESPIRATORYGoals of treatment of acute asthma exacerbations include:
General principles in the treatment of acute asthma:• To relieve airway obstruction and hypoxaemia or hypercapnea as quickly as possible
• To prevent complications and death
• To prevent further relapses
• Assessing severity ( mild, moderate, severe or life-threatening ) while starting bronchodilator treatment 
immediately
 ÊBased on parameters:  respiratory rate, colour, SpO 2, respiratory effort, degree of dyspnoea, 
auscultatory lung findings and conscious level
• Severe acute exacerbation is characterized by hypoxia (SpO 2 in air < 92%), too breathless to talk or 
speak in one word, tachynoea (RR > 30/min in >5 years, RR > 40/min in 1-5 years old), tachycardia (HR 
>125/min in > 5 year, > 140/min in 1-5 years old) and PEF 33-50% best or predicted. 
• Life-threatening exacerbation features include hypoxia (SpO 2 air < 92%), silent chest, cyanosis, poor 
respiratory effort, hypotension, exhaustion, confusion and PEF <30% best or predicted.
• The Paediatric Asthma Score (PAS) is one of the methods used to assess severity of acute asthma 
exacerbation without performing lung function test (Table 12). 
• Administering oxygen therapy if pulse oximetry (SpO 2) is < 94% in children.
• Treatment and re-assessments within the indicated time frame according to the Acute Paediatric 
Asthma Exacerbation Management Pathway (Table 13).
• Administering systemic corticosteroids within the first hour of treatment
• Repeated reassessment of response to treatment and treatment decision (either continuing treatment 
or adding on treatments) until acute asthma has resolved.

182 183
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 7         RESPIRATORYFirst line treatment or standard therapy:
1. Bronchodilators:
2. Oxygen:
3. Steroid: ÊInhaled short acting β 2-agonists (SABA): the first line of treatment 
 ÊpMDI plus spacer is more efficient than nebulizer. It is a preferred method in mild to moderate 
acute asthma.
 ÊThe nebulised oxygen-driven SABA + SAMA (short acting muscarinic agonists) is recommended in 
severe and life-threatening acute asthma (beware of high risk of transmitting viral infections during 
a respiratory pandemic as aerosolized droplets can spread for several meters and remain airborne 
for more than 30 minutes)
 ÊFrequent doses of ipratropium bromide (SAMA) (every 20–30 minutes) used in addition to β2 
agonists for the first hour may be continued for a maximum of two hours for a severe asthma 
attack. It is safe and efficacious especially in the most severe patients. The ipratropium dose should 
be tapered to four to six hourly or discontinued.
 ÊParenteral SABA should be considered in children with severe or life-threatening exacerbations
 ÊThe inhaled bronchodilators and oxygen are crucial in relieving hypoxia.
 ÊOxygen therapy should be titrated using pulse oximetry to maintain SpO2 94-98%. Titrated/
controlled oxygen therapy is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes. 
 ÊIn acutely distressed patients, give oxygen driven nebulised bronchodilators
 ÊIn less severe exacerbations, oxygen can be delivered via nasal prong (especially if using MDI SABAs) 
or face-mask oxygen. 
 ÊClose SpO2 monitoring is important as SpO2 may drop during sleep
 ÊIt can be administered via the oral or IV route (similar efficacy).  
 ÊThe oral route is preferred as it is quicker to serve, less expensive and less invasive. 
 ÊThe IV route is indicated in children who are vomiting, unable to tolerate orally and children with 
severe or life-threatening exacerbations 
 ÊOral and parenteral corticosteroid need at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement 
 ÊThey are usually given for 3-5 days for children and 5-7 days for adolescents 12 years and above and 
weaning is unnecessary unless the course of steroid exceeds 14 days 
 ÊConsider nebulised corticosteroid (Budesonide) combined with SABA and SAMA every 20 minutes 
during the first hour of treatment in patients with severe /life-threatening asthma 
 ÊNebulised corticosteroids have rapid onset of action than systemic corticosteroids [few seconds 
to minutes versus 4 hours] via non-genomic effect of inhaled-corticosteroid (ICS). They also have 
vasoconstrictor effect on the airway mucosa which leads to decrease airway blood flow and reduce 
clearance of bronchodilators from the airway. ICS potentiates the effect of bronchodilators. 
Second line / adjunct therapies: Systemic Bronchodilators: 
Should be initiated when there is no response to the first line treatment, Paediatric Asthma Score (PAS) 
either remains the same or there is further deterioration (suggesting that the inhaled therapy may not 
reach the airway), or patient is having severe or acute life-threatening exacerbation. 
 ÊConsider IV Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO 4) as first line option for adjunct/second line intravenous 
treatment of severe or life-threatening exacerbations. It is safe and beneficial.
 ÊAnother alternative or as add on treatment is IV Salbutamol β 2 agonist or Terbutaline. Subcutaneous 
terbutaline can be used in children with no IV access.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 7         RESPIRATORYFootnotes on Management of Acute Exacerbation of Asthma:
1. Monitor vital signs such as pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (BP), SpO 2, colour at least 4 
hourly.
2. Hydration – normal maintenance unless intubated then to restrict to 2/3rd maintenance.
3. IV Magnesium Sulphate: Consider adjunct treatment early in severe /life-threatening exacerbations 
unresponsive to the initial treatment. 
4. Ventilatory support: Early use of High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) 
in patients with moderate to severe respiratory distress may prevent intubation. Intubation and 
mechanical ventilation should be considered in patients with established acute respiratory failure or 
showed no improvement with HFNC or NIV despite optimal medical therapies.
5. Role of Aminophylline is debated due to its potential toxicity. To be used with caution, in a controlled 
environment like ICU.
6. Antibiotics indicated only if bacterial infection or pneumonia is suspected.
7. Chest x-ray is not routinely recommended and must not compromise emergency treatment. It is 
indicated if suspected complications e.g. pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, lung collapse or 
concomitant pneumonia.
8. ABG: should be considered in severe and life-threatening asthma. Normal or raised PaCO 2 levels are 
indicative of worsening asthma.
9. For school aged children, monitor PEF twice /day (am, pm) and pre & post bronchodilator.
10. Avoid sedatives and mucolytics.
11. Antihistamines and IM Adrenaline – therapy of anaphylaxis and angioedema associated with asthma 
exacerbations.
12. Avoid chest physiotherapy as it may increase patient discomfort
13. Efficacy of prednisolone in the first year of life is poor.
14. Discharge criteria:
• Stable on 4 hourly inhaled bronchodilators (can by continued at home)
• Clinically stable, able to eat and sleep well, and PAS ≤7 
• SpO 2 >94% in room air. 
• Post bronchodilator PEF and/or FEV1 should be > 70% of best or predicted  
• Follow up by primary care services within two weeks or earlier.
• Follow up in a paediatric asthma clinic within one to two months
15. On discharge, patients must be provided with an Asthma Action Plan to assist parents or patients to 
prevent/terminate asthma attacks.
The plan must include:
a. How to recognize worsening asthma
b. How to treat worsening asthma
c. How and when to seek medical attention
16. Salbutamol MDI vs nebulized therapy
< 6 year old: 6 x 100 mcg puff = 2.5 mg Salbutamol nebules.
> 6 year old: 12 x 100 mcg puff = 5.0 mg Salbutamol nebules.
Criteria for hospital admission
• Failure to respond to standard home treatment.
• Failure of those with mild or moderate acute asthma to respond to nebulised β₂-agonists.
• Relapse within 4 hours of nebulised β₂- agonists.
• Severe or life-threatening acute asthma.

Acute Bronchiolitis
Aetiology and Epidemiology
Clinical Features• A common respiratory illness in children under 2 years of age and most commonly in the first year of 
life, peaking between 3 and 6 months old.
• Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) remains the commonest cause of acute bronchiolitis in Malaysia and 
worldwide.
• Although it is endemic throughout the year, cyclical periodicity with annual peaks occurs, in the months 
of October, November, December and January
• Acute bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis which typically presents with mild coryza, low grade fever and 
cough followed by tachypnoea, chest recession, wheeze and respiratory distress. 
• The chest may be hyperinflated and auscultation findings include crackles/crepitations, rhonchi, or 
both.
• Young infants (in particular those under 6 weeks of age) may present with apnoea without other clinical 
signs. 
• The majority of children with viral bronchiolitis have a mild illness and only about 1% of these children 
require hospital admission
High Risk Group for Severe Bronchiolitis
• Age < 12 weeks
• Premature birth
• Underlying cardiopulmonary disease
• Underlying immunodeficiency
• Underlying neuromuscular disordersGuidelines for hospital admission in Viral Bronchiolitis

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 7         RESPIRATORYDifferential Diagnosis
Consider a diagnosis of pneumonia if the infant or child has:
• high fever (over 39°C) and/or 
• persistent focal crackles/crepitations 
• severe respiratory distress
Consider a diagnosis of viral-induced wheeze or early-onset asthma rather than bronchiolitis in older infants 
and young children if they have: 
• persistent wheeze without crackles/crepitations or 
• recurrent episodic wheeze or 
• a personal or family history of atopy 
Management
General measures
• Careful assessment of the respiratory status and oxygenation is critical.
• Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO 2) should be performed at presentation and maintained 
between 94-98% by supplementary oxygen if required. 
• Monitor for signs of impending respiratory failure:
 ÊSigns of exhaustion (eg listlessness or decreased respiratory effort)
 ÊRecurrent apnoea 
 ÊFailure to maintain adequate oxygen saturation despite oxygen supplementation 
• Very young infants who are at risk of apnoea require greater vigilance. Investigations
• Blood tests 
 ÊRoutine full blood count and bacteriological testing is not recommended in infants or children with 
typical acute bronchiolitis.
 ÊConsider capillary blood gas in infants or children with severe worsening respiratory distress or 
impending respiratory failure.
• Chest X-Ray 
• A wide range of radiological changes are seen in viral bronchiolitis:
 ÊHyperinflation (most common)
 ÊSegmental collapse/consolidation
 ÊLobar collapse/consolidation
• A chest x-ray is not routinely recommended, but can be considered for infants or children with:
 ÊSevere respiratory distress
 ÊUnusual clinical features
 ÊAn underlying cardiac or chronic respiratory disorder
 ÊAdmission to the intensive care

Section 7         RESPIRATORYSupportive therapy
• Nasal suctioning 
 ÊDo not routinely perform upper airway suctioning in all infants or children with bronchiolitis. 
 ÊConsider gentle superficial nasal suctioning especially in younger infants who have respiratory 
distress or feeding difficulties because of upper airway secretions. As young infants are obligate 
nasal breathers, therefore clearing the nares may improve the work of breathing and feeding.
• Chest physiotherapy 
 ÊNo evidence of benefit of any type of chest physiotherapy among children with acute bronchiolitis 
in regards to length of hospital stays, oxygen saturation or respiratory parameters
Nutrition and Fluid Therapy
• Small and frequent feeding as tolerated can be allowed in children with mild and moderate respiratory 
distress.
• In children with poor feeding, nasogastric or orogastric feeding can be commenced.
• Consider intravenous fluids in infants or children who: 
 ÊDo not tolerate nasogastric or orogastric fluids or 
 ÊHave impending respiratory failure. 
Pharmacotherapy
1. Hypertonic saline
 ÊNot routinely recommended.
 ÊThere is not enough evidence to routinely recommend nebulised hypertonic 3% saline solution for 
acute bronchiolitis, as more recent trials and systematic reviews have shown unclear benefits of 
nebulised hypertonic solution in the management of acute bronchiolitis.
2. Inhaled Bronchodilators 
 ÊNot routinely recommended.
 ÊAdministration of inhaled bronchodilators (such as salbutamol/terbutaline/ipratropium bromide) to 
infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis do not improve oxygen saturation, duration of symptoms or 
length of hospital stay.
 ÊHowever, it might sometimes be difficult to distinguish between wheeze of bronchiolitis and that of 
early asthma or viral induced wheeze in older infants. Therefore, in infants with persistent wheeze 
without crackles/crepitations, the possibility of bronchodilator responsive wheeze (particularly if 
there is a personal or family history of atopy) can be considered.
3. Corticosteroids 
 ÊNot routinely recommended.
 ÊCorticosteroids, both systemic (such as dexamethasone or prednisolone) and inhaled, are not 
associated with a clinically significant improvement in disease, as measured by reduction in clinical 
scores, rates of hospitalization and length of hospital stay.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 7         RESPIRATORYRespiratory support
 ÊHigh Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive 
airway pressure (BIPAP) are increasingly used as modalities of non-invasive respiratory support for 
infants with acute, moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis.  
 ÊClose monitoring of patients on HFNC and CPAP are needed to prevent deterioration and for early 
detection of progressive respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
Prevention
 ÊGeneral prevention of RSV bronchiolitis includes hand hygiene, avoiding exposure to sick contacts and 
cigarette smoke exposure, and preferably maternal RSV vaccination at 32-36 weeks gestation.
 ÊThe availability of long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody (eg. Nirsevimab) that cover one RSV season 
offers a better alternative than a short-acting one.
 ÊThe indications of RSV monoclonal antibody include chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP)/ 
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) requiring oxygen or medications, haemodynamically significant 
congenital heart diseases, severe immunodeficiency and extreme prematurity (for Palivizumab).4. Antibiotics 
 ÊNot routinely recommended as acute bronchiolitis has a viral aetiology and the rate of secondary 
bacterial infection is extremely low.
 ÊA detailed review of randomised clinical trials found that the routine use of antibiotics did not 
improve the duration of symptoms, length of hospital stays, the need for oxygen therapy, or 
hospital admission. 
 ÊAntibiotics can be considered for infants with: 
• Recurrent apnoea and circulatory impairment
• Possibility of septicaemia
• Acute clinical deterioration
• High white cell count
• Progressive interstitial changes on chest radiograph

Viral Croup
Aetiology and Epidemiology
Clinical Features
Diagnosis• A clinical syndrome characterised by barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarse voice and respiratory 
distress of varying severity.
• A result of viral inflammation of the larynx, trachea and bronchi, hence the term 
laryngotracheobronchitis .
• The most common pathogen is parainfluenza virus (74%), (types 1, 2 and 3). The others are Respiratory 
Syncytial Virus, Influenza virus types A and B, Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Measles, Mumps and 
Rhinoviruses and rarely Mycoplasma pneumoniae  and Corynebacterium Diptheriae . Also seen in SARS-
CoV-2 especially the Omicron variant 
• Low grade fever, cough and coryza for 12-72 hours, followed by:
• Increasingly bark-like cough and hoarseness.
• Stridor that may occur when excited, at rest or both.
• Respiratory distress of varying degree.
• Croup is a clinical diagnosis. However, need to consider other life-threatening differential diagnoses 
such as acute epiglottitis, retropharyngeal / parapharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, foreign body 
aspiration, diphtheria and congenital upper airway abnormalities (laryngomalacia, laryngeal web, vocal 
cord palsy, subglottic stenosis).
• Studies show that it is safe to visualise the pharynx to exclude acute epiglottitis, retropharyngeal 
abscess etc. 
• In severe croup, it is advisable to examine the pharynx under controlled conditions such as in the ICU or 
Operation Theatre.
• A neck radiograph is not necessary, unless the diagnosis is in doubt, such as in the exclusion of a foreign 
body.

• Moderate and severe viral croup.
• Age less than 6 months.
• Poor oral intake.
• Toxic, sick appearance.
• Family lives a long distance from hospital; lacks reliable transport.
Treatment (refer to Management Algorithm of Viral croup )
• The sustained action of steroids combined with the quick action of adrenaline may reduce the rate of 
intubation from 3% to nil.
• Antibiotics are not recommended unless superimposed bacterial infection is strongly suspected or the 
patient is very ill.
• Intravenous fluids are not usually necessary except for those unable to drink.
• With the Covid-19 pandemic, it is important to minimise distress to the child, as this can worsen upper 
airway obstruction. Hence, COVID-19 testing should not routinely be performed until deemed safe to do.• Pulse oximetry is helpful but not essential
• Arterial blood gas is not helpful because the blood parameters may remain normal to the late stage. The 
process of blood taking may distress the child.Clinical features Assigned Score

Pneumonia
Definition
Assessment of severity of pneumoniaAetiologyThere are two clinical definitions of pneumonia:
• Bronchopneumonia:  a febrile illness with cough, respiratory distress with evidence of localised or 
generalised patchy infiltrates.
• Lobar pneumonia:  similar to bronchopneumonia, except that the physical findings and radiographs 
indicate lobar consolidation.
The predictive value of respiratory rate for the diagnosis of pneumonia may be improved by making it age 
specific. Tachypnoea is defined as follows:
< 2 months age                  : > 60 /min 
2- 12 months age               : > 50 /min
12 months – 5 years age   : > 40 /min
Severe pneumonia should be considered if there are clinical features of pneumonia and one or more of 
these criteria:• It is often difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial disease.
• Overall, viruses were found to account for around 60% of pneumonia cases, and bacteria for 30% 
pneumonia cases. 
• The common viral aetiological fraction was attributable to Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Influenza A or B, 
Adenovirus, Parainfluenza Virus, SARS-CoV 2
• A helpful indicator in predicting aetiological agents is the age group. The predominant bacterial 
pathogens are shown in the table below:
Pathogens for Pneumonia
Age Bacterial Pathogens
Newborns Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacteriaceae
Infants 1- 3 months Chlamydia trachomatis
Preschool age Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Staphylococcal aureus
Less common: Group A Streptococcus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa
School age Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and similar to the preschool age 
group pathogens
Tachypnoea as defined above or markedly 
reduced respiratory rate as child tires out 
with moderate to severe respiratory distressSignificant tachycardia or bradycardia +/- poor perfusion
Unable to take orally

Investigations and assessment
Children with bacterial pneumonia cannot be reliably distinguished from those with viral disease on the 
basis of any single parameter. Following are helpful investigations:
• Chest radiograph
• Indicated when clinical criteria suggest pneumonia, but not always necessary if facilities are not 
available or pneumonia is mild.
• Does not differentiate aetiological agents, but a lobar consolidation pattern suggests bacterial 
infection and an interstitial pattern suggests viral or atypical agent infection.
• White blood cell count
• Increased counts with predominance of polymorphonuclear cells suggest bacterial cause.
• Leucopenia suggests either a viral cause or severe overwhelming infection.
• Blood culture
• Sensitivity is low: Positive blood cultures only in 10%-30% of patients.
• Do cultures in severe pneumonia or if poor response to first line antibiotics.
• Serological tests
• Serology is performed in patients with suspected atypical pneumonia,
• i.e., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, Legionella, Moraxella catarrhalis
• Acute phase serum titre for Mycoplasma pneumoniae  infection, > 1:160 or paired samples taken 
2-4 weeks apart  with a 4-fold rise is a good indicator of infection. This test should be considered for 
children aged five years or older.
• Acute phase reactants (particularly CRP)
• Should not be used routinely in all cases of pneumonia
• If the test is available, combining elevated CRP (>72mg/L) with the presence of clinical signs/ 
symptoms can help differentiate definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia 
• Nasal pharyngeal aspirate or nasal swab for viruses (depending on which panel is offered at your 
setting)
• A less invasive diagnostic respiratory specimen, not routinely needed
• Consider discontinuing antibiotics if proven positive
• If positive for Influenza – to consider treating with Oseltamivir
• Sputum culture and sensitivity
• Sputum culture is not routinely performed in children, as it is difficult to get children to expectorate 
a specimen and the clinical interpretation cannot be standardised
• Should be considered in severely ill patients, to guide treatment 
• Pleural fluid analysis
• If there is significant pleural effusion, drainage and pleural fluid analysis will be helpful in 
management.
Assessment of oxygenation
• Objective measurement of hypoxia by pulse oximetry avoids the need for arterial blood gases. It is a 
good indicator of the severity of pneumonia.

Criteria for hospitalisation
Management• Mild community acquired pneumonia can be treated at home
• Identify indicators of severity in children who need admission, as pneumonia can be fatal. The following 
indicators can be used as a guide for admission:
• Children aged 3 months and below, whatever the severity of pneumonia.
• Fever (more than 38.5 ⁰C), refusal to feed and vomiting
• Fast breathing with or without cyanosis
• Associated systemic manifestation
• Failure of previous antibiotic therapy
• Recurrent pneumonia
• Persistent pneumonia
• Severe underlying disorder, e.g., Immunodeficiency
• Consideration of antibiotics :
When treating pneumonia, consider clinical, laboratory, radiographic findings, as well as age of the 
child, and the local epidemiology of respiratory pathogens and resistance/sensitivity patterns to 
microbial agents.
• Severity of the pneumonia and drug costs also impact on selection of therapy.
• Anti-viral therapy

breath sound over affected lobe.
• Parapneumonic effusion, empyema thoracis, necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess and bronchopleural 
fistula need to be considered.
• Repeat chest x-ray, and consider ultrasound thorax if the above complications are suspected
• Early consult with a paediatric respiratory specialist is advised
• Occasionally a CT thorax is warranted in cases where necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess or 
bronchopleural fistula is suspected
• Staphylococcus aureus  is responsible for a small proportion of cases.
• A high index of suspicion is required because of the potential for rapid deterioration. It chiefly occurs in 
infants with a significant risk of mortality.
• Radiological features include multilobar consolidation, cavitation, pneumatoceles, spontaneous 
pneumothorax, empyema, pleural effusion.
• Treat with high dose Cloxacillin (200 mg/kg/day) for a longer duration
• Drainage of empyema often results in a good outcome.
• It is a result of localized bronchiolar and alveolar necrosis.
• Aetiological agents are bacteria, e.g., S taphylococcal aureus, S. Pneumonia, H. Influenza, Klebsiella 
pneumonia  and E. coli .
• Give IV antibiotics until child shows signs of improvement.
• Total antibiotics course duration of at least 3 to 4 weeks.

Empyema Thoracis in Children
Introduction
Pathophysiology of Para-Pneumonic EffusionEmpyema thoracis is a complication from respiratory infection with pus formation in the pleural cavity. 
Common pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, 
Hemophilus influenza and occasionally gram-negative bacilli like Salmonella spp. Tuberculosis should be 
considered in cases with unresolved empyema thoracis and contact risk.
Para-Pneumonic effusion (PPE) can be divided into 3 stages depending on onset of the disease and disease 
progression1. (Figure 1)

Radiological Imaging in Para-pneumonic effusion (PPE)
Management of Empyema Thoracis
i. Anti-microbial therapyInitial presentation of PPE is similar with other lower respiratory tract infections e.g. fever and cough. 
Complications of pneumonia should be suspected with worsening or persistent symptoms and signs after 48 
hours of antibiotic treatment. Further assessment with repeat Chest radiograph and ultrasound Thorax are 
required for confirmation of PPE diagnosis and staging of its severity.
An ultrasound of the Thorax is the most important radiological investigation in determining the stage of 
the PPE to guide appropriate treatment. Daily Chest Radiograph or Ultrasound Thorax is not necessary. 
Computed Tomography Thorax (CT Thorax) is not indicated in most cases.There are three imaging modalities required in managing PPE. Chest radiograph is essential in detecting 
fluid in the pleural cavity. (Figure 2) 
The principle of management include good and adequate anti-microbial therapy, pleural fluid drainage and 
supportive care which include oxygen therapy, fluid and nutritional management.
The anti-microbial of choice is Penicillin or Cephalosporins e.g. Cefuroxime and Ceftriaxone. In young 
children, Cloxacillin may be considered for staphylococcus infection. Carbapenem may be considered 
in cases not responding to Penicillin or Cephalosporins. Parenteral administration of anti-microbial is 
important during initial phase. However, the total duration of therapy including oral therapy varies from 
three to six weeks; determined by the severity of disease.Figure 2: Chest radiograph of Left Para-pneumonic effusion (PPE)2a: Before drainage 2b: After drainage

ii. Pleural drainage
a. Pleural Drainage with Intra-Pleural Fibrinolytic agent therapyPleural fluid must be drained as soon as possible for both diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic 
purposes. Indications for continuous pleural drainage include respiratory distress, moderate to large 
amount of pleural fluid and septicaemia. Evaluation of pleural fluid is important to identify the causal 
pathogens.  
In the late Stage 1 or early Stage 2, additional intra-pleural fibrinolytic agent like Urokinase or 
Streptokinase will facilitate the drainage of pleural fluid, reduce hospital stay and may avoid surgical 
intervention. The intra-pleural fibrinolytic agent in Stage 3 is not indicated.
Intra-pleural fibrinolytic agent is generally safe when used cautiously. Contraindications of intra-
pleural fibrinolytic therapy are haemothorax, pneumothorax and hypersensitive to intra-pleural 
fibrinolytic agents. Complications of intra-pleural fibrinolytic therapy are uncommon such as fever, 
intra-pleural haemorrhage, pain and allergic reaction. Intra-pleural fibrinolytic therapy technique is 
described in Figure 4.

iii. Surgical intervention in Empyema Thoracis
SUMMARYThere are two surgical procedures available for empyema thoracic in Malaysia i.e. Video-assisted 
Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy with debridement and decortication. 
Approach for Para-Pneumonic Effusion in children is dependent on its severity. Staging of PPE via ultrasound 
Thorax is crucial to determine type of therapy. Additional therapy with Intra-pleural Fibrinolytic agent is useful 
in Late Stage 1 and Stage 2 but not Stage 3. Summary of the approach and management is outlined in Figure 5.

Sleep Disordered Breathing
Introduction 
EpidemiologyDefinitions 
Risk Factors• Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a collection of ventilatory disorders characterized by 
recurrent partial or complete cessation of breathing resulting in multitude of night and day time 
symptoms
• Upper airway dysfunction during sleep characterised by snoring and/or increased respiratory effort that 
result from increased upper airway resistance and pharyngeal collapsibility.
• Sleep disordered breathing is a spectrum of breathing disorders ranging from benign snoring to 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) depending on the varying degree of airway obstruction.
• Snoring occurs in 7% of children 
• Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) occurs in 1 – 5 % of children
• Most prominent between 2 – 6 years old • Primary snoring: 
Habitual snoring (>3 nights per week) without apnoeas, hypopnoeas, frequent arousals from sleep or 
gas exchange abnormalities
• Upper airway resistance syndrome:
Snoring, increased work of breathing, frequent arousals, but no recognisable obstructive events or gas 
exchange abnormalities
• Obstructive hypoventilation:
Snoring and abnormally elevated end-expiratory carbon dioxide partial pressure in the absence of 
recognisable obstructive events
• Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA): 
Recurrent events of partial or complete upper airway obstruction (hypopnoeas, obstructive or mixed 
apnoeas) with disruption of normal oxygenation, ventilation and sleep pattern
• Adenotonsillar hypertrophy
• Obesity
• Allergic rhinitis
• Craniofacial anomalies (Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, unrepaired or repaired 
cleft palate, Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome)
• Neuromuscular disorders (cerebral palsy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic muscular dystrophy)
• Syndromes (Down syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome)
• Complex abnormalities (achondroplasia, Chiari malformation, mucopolysaccharidoses)
• Prematurity
• Family history of OSA

• Based on BOTH clinical and polysomnographic criteria 
a. Clinical Criteria (As above in Clinical Features)
b. Polysomnographic Criteria (based on obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (OAHI) from 
polysomnography) 
i. Normal: 
OAHI < 1 events / hour
ii. Mild OSA:
OAHI 1 – 4.9 events / hour
iii. Moderate OSA:
OAHI 5 – 9.9 events / hour
iv. Severe OSA:
OAHI ≥ 10 events / hour
• Nocturnal oximetry trending – The McGill Oximetry Scoring System can be used to stratify the severity 
of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in children and thus to prioritize their treatment1. To confirm/support the diagnosis
Polysomnography
• Level 1: Attended Polysomnography – the gold standard, highly recommended for patients with 
sleep disordered breathing symptoms and co-morbidities
• Level 2: Unattended Polysomnography
• Level 3: Partial Polysomnography/ Home sleep testing
• Level 4: Nocturnal oximetry trending – Recommended for anaesthesia risk stratification for adeno-
tonsillectomy patients without co-morbidities
2. To evaluate the cause/co-morbidities
• Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy - often used to identify potential sites of airway obstruction 
in children (e.g. enlarged nasal turbinates, septal deviation, adenoid hypertrophy, lingual tonsil 
hypertrophy, tongue base prolapses and laryngomalacia). However, it is limited by lack of children 
cooperation and it may not capture the dynamic of upper airway collapse that may occur 
exclusively during sleep
• Drug induced sleep endoscopy - is commonly performed for children who have undergone previous 
or prior to adenotonsillectomy. It is done in children who are at high-risk for persistent obstructive 
sleep apnoea (OSA) including those with obesity, severe OSA, Down syndrome, craniofacial 
anomalies, hypotonia and neurologic impairment
• Electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram - to evaluate the consequences of sleep disordered 
breathing on cardiovascular system
• Airway radiograph (lateral neck X-ray, CT / MRI head and neck) can be considered in cases 
with suspected airway anomalies / craniofacial anomalies AFTER discussion with respiratory 
paediatrician / otorhinolaryngology surgeon / plastic surgeon / oral and maxillofacial surgeon etc.

Chronic Wet Cough and Bronchiectasis
• Chronic cough is a common symptom in children and it is defined as chronic if the duration of cough 
is more than 4 weeks  in children. Any chronic cough, especially if wet or productive, warrants further 
evaluation. 
• Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB)   is one of the most common aetiology in children with chronic wet 
cough, however, it has remained largely unrecognised. 
 ÊProtracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a clinical diagnosis of chronic wet or productive cough (>4 
weeks), in an otherwise well child  (often normal physical examination and chest radiograph) , that 
responds to a 2 weeks course of an appropriate antibiotic. 
 ÊConfirmed PBB is when there is a  positive bacterial culture of sputum or BAL (usual organisms are 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis ). 
 ÊExtended PBB - Patients with chronic wet cough who requires a longer duration of antibiotic of 4 
weeks for symptoms resolution. 
 ÊPatients with recurrent episodes of PBB in a year (especially if extended PBB) are at higher risk of 
developing bronchiectasis.
• Bronchiectasis - It is originally defined as permanent/irreversible dilatation of the bronchus. Currently, 
it is defined as a clinical syndrome of chronic or recurrent wet / productive cough with radiological 
confirmation of bronchial wall dilatation (paediatric Broncho-Arterial ratio (BAR) > 0.8 by High 
Resolution CT Scan (HRCT) of the thorax in paediatrics). The radiographic bronchial wall dilatation is 
potentially reversible in early stage of bronchiectasis. The syndrome is characterised by dilated and 
thickened wall causing mucous retention, bacterial colonisation and destruction of the surrounding 
tissue due to excessive chronic airway inflammation.
• Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD)  is a term coined for clinical wet cough syndrome WITHOUT 
chest HRCT findings of bronchiectasis.

• Bronchiectasis is the ‘end-consequence’ of many conditions related to recurrent and/or persistent 
respiratory infections. It is important to identify the underlying aetiologies of bronchiectasis as early 
treatment may prevent irreversible bronchial structure and further progression of bronchiectasis. Cystic 
Fibrosis (CF) Bronchiectasis is highly prevalent in Caucasian ethnicity. This chapter mainly focuses on 
Non-CF Bronchiectasis.
• The aetiologies vary between high income and low to medium income countries, where post-infectious 
and idiopathic causes are prevalent in the latter countries.
• Thorough history taking, physical examination and targeted investigations are essential.

• Investigations are directed towards confirmation of bronchiectasis, identifying underlying aetiology if 
possible and to assess baseline severity of bronchiectasis and lung impairment.
1. Imaging techniques of diagnosis confirmation:
• HRCT Thorax: is the gold standard imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis. 
• The emerging technique is MRI of the chest.
• Chest radiograph: there is poor agreement between CXR and HRCT findings. Abnormal chest 
radiograph should alert the possibility of bronchiectasis in a typical clinical context, however a 
normal CXR does not exclude bronchiectasis.
2. Investigations to ascertain the underlying diagnosis are listed in the flow diagram (figure 2).
3. Spirometry does not provide diagnostic information but may serve as a marker of disease severity 
and progression of lung function. It may show obstructive, restrictive or even mixed obstructive and 
restrictive lung disease.Table 3: HRCT features of bronchiectasis

• ACT remains the key intervention in children and adolescents with chronic suppurative lung disease.
• Individualised ACT that is development- and age-appropriate (table 4) is best taught by a paediatric-
trained chest physiotherapist.
• The ACT type and frequency should be reviewed at least biannually by physiotherapists as children 
or adolescents mature.
Table 4: Types of ACT in different age groupsManagement
Management of bronchiectasis can be divided into management during stable state and during a respiratory 
exacerbation.
• Baseline respiratory symptoms, chest signs and respiratory support (if present) should be documented 
for each child or adolescent with bronchiectasis during their stable state.

• Inhaled mannitol or hypertonic saline (HS) may be considered in selected patients with:
 ÊHigh daily symptoms
 ÊFrequent exacerbations
 ÊDifficulty in expectoration 
 ÊPoor quality of life (QoL)
• If well tolerated, the use of HS or mannitol could improve the QoL and facilitate expectoration. 
• For HS and mannitol, children should be old enough to tolerate these interventions with pre-
inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA).
• The first dose of HS or mannitol should be administered under medical supervision. 
• In children or adolescents with bronchiectasis, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with or without long-
acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are not routinely recommended in either the short or long-term, 
irrespective of stability or exacerbation. 
• ICS may be beneficial in those with eosinophilic airway inflammation, or asthma.
• If treatment with ICS or ICS/LABA is contemplated, every effort should be made to document acute 
bronchodilator sensitivity (acute spirometric response to SABA), atopy (skin prick tests, specific 
IgE) and airway eosinophilia (peripheral blood eosinophil count, sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric 
oxide).
• Children and adolescents with bronchiectasis are recommended to be fully immunised according to 
their national immunisation programmes, including pneumococcal and annual seasonal influenza 
vaccines. 
• Every child or adolescent with bronchiectasis is recommended to have a personalised action plan 
that is discussed with the child and caregiver, and should be reviewed regularly.2. Antibiotics to reduce exacerbations
• Long-term macrolide antibiotics is recommended in children or adolescents with bronchiectasis 
who have had:
 Ê>1 hospitalised exacerbation or
 Ê≥3 non-hospitalised exacerbations in the past 12 months.
• Each course should last for at least 6 months with regular reassessment to determine whether the 
antibiotic continues to provide a clinical benefit.
• Children or adolescents receiving longer treatment courses (>24-months) should continue to be 
evaluated for risk versus benefit.
• It is recommended to obtain a lower airway specimen (when possible) to exclude their presence 
before commencing long-term macrolide antibiotics.

• Antibiotic treatment for acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis are considered standard of care.
• This has been shown to resolve symptoms and reduce the duration of exacerbations.
• Mild exacerbations
 ÊThe empiric antibiotic of choice is oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for 14 days. 
 ÊHowever, the type of antibiotics should be based on the patient’s airway culture (e.g. those with 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  require different treatment regimens to those without) and history of 
antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions.
• Severe exacerbations or mild exacerbations that fail to respond to a course of oral amoxicillin-
clavulanate for 14 days
 ÊAdmit for intravenous antibiotics and intensive ACT.Respiratory Exacerbation
Management during exacerbations• Definition
 ÊIncreased respiratory symptoms (predominantly increased cough +/- increased sputum quantity +/- 
purulence) for ≥ 3 days. 
 ÊFor those with immunodeficiency, a lower threshold is suggested (as commencing treatment earlier 
may be required). 
 ÊClinicians should not rely on changes in chest auscultation findings and chest x-rays to diagnose an 
exacerbation as, although important, these findings are not always present.
 ÊBlood markers (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein, neutrophilia and interleukin-6) provide supportive 
evidence of the presence of an exacerbation.
• Severe exacerbation
 ÊPresence of dyspnoea (increased work of breathing) +/- hypoxia, irrespective of duration. 
1. Airway clearance therapy (ACT)
• A more intensive and frequent ACT during acute exacerbations have been shown to have no 
adverse events, with improved sputum clearance, lung function and symptoms. 
• Adjustment to the type of ACT during exacerbations may be necessary (eg. exercises may not be 
feasible).

Conclusion
The aim of managing children and adolescents with bronchiectasis is to optimise lung growth, preserve 
lung function, improve quality of life, minimise exacerbations, prevent complications and, if possible when 
diagnosed early, reverse bronchial wall dilatation as a marker of structural lung injury.

• Most changes relate to the ratio of LV to RV weight
• Birth: RV thicker than LV
• End of the first month: LV heavier than RV (Ratio of LV:RV = 1.5:1)
• By 6 months of age: Ratio of LV/RV = 2:1
• Young adult: Ratio of LV/RV = 2.5:1P wave  - atrial depolarization
PR segment - slow conduction through the AV node (AV node delay)
QRS complex - depolarization of ventricles
T wave  - repolarization of ventriclesPaediatric ECG has a significant role in evaluating children with congenital and acquired cardiovascular 
pathology. However, it is one of the most often misinterpreted tests in paediatric medicine due to failure 
to consider age-related developmental changes that occur throughout life from the neonatal period to the

QRS axis changes with age: From +125° at birth (range +30° to +180°) to a mean value of +50° by the 
age of 3 years (adult range -10° to +110°).
Superior axis deviation (-90° to 180°) is an abnormal finding and can be seen in children with 
atrioventricular septal defects, tricuspid atresia, inlet ventricular septal defects or after pacemaker 
implantation.

Types of CCHD Comments Intervention
Ductal 
dependent 
pulmonary 
circulation• Critical right outflow tract obstructive lesions 
causing inadequate pulmonary perfusion, 
maintained by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 
• PDA closure causes extreme cyanosis and 
hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <75%), which 
may lead to hemodynamic instability
• Example: Critical pulmonary stenosis or atresia• Stabilize with IV infusion of 
Prostaglandin E (IVI PGE) 
• Early surgical or catheter 
interventions, e.g. Blalock 
Taussig shunt, PDA stenting, 
pulmonary balloon 
valvuloplasty
Ductal 
dependent 
systemic 
circulation• Critical left outflow tract obstructive lesions 
leading to compromised systemic perfusion, 
maintained by PDA
• PDA closure causes impaired systemic 
perfusion, end-organ damage, and shock
• Example: Critical CoA, IAA, critical AS, HLHS• Stabilize with IVI PGE
• Early surgical or catheter 
interventions, e.g. surgical 
repair of aortic arch, balloon 
angioplasty or valvuloplasty
TGA with poor 
mixing• TGA with restrictive and inadequate intra-
cardiac mixing defects (PFO/ASD/VSD)
• Causes rapid and progressive severe cyanosis 
and hemodynamic instability
• PDA alone without good intra-cardiac mixing 
may not be sufficient to achieve adequate 
oxygenation• Emergency balloon atrial 
septostomy (BAS)
• IVI PGE while waiting for 
transfer to cardiac center
• Early surgical repair with 
arterial switch operation
Obstructed 
TAPVD• TAPVD with obstruction of vertical vein 
draining pulmonary venous confluence 
• Highest incidence in infra-cardiac type, 
followed by supra-cardiac type
• Causes severe pulmonary edema and 
pulmonary hypertension, resulting in severe 
hypoxemia and cyanosis, difficulty ventilating 
and hemodynamic instability
• Obstruction can also occur at atrial level if PFO 
is restrictive• Emergency TAPVD repair

• Starting dose: 10 – 40 ng/kg/min; maintenance: 2 – 10ng/kg/min
• Adverse effects: apnoea (12%, particularly neonates < 2 kg), fever (14%), flushing (10%), hypotension 
(4%); prolonged use can cause cortical proliferation of long bones
• Monitoring for clinical response
 →Ductal dependent pulmonary circulation: monitor systemic arterial oxygen saturation, titrate IVI 
PGE to achieve saturation of 80-90% to avoid over-shunting and heart failure
 →Ductal dependent systemic circulation: monitor distal perfusion (pulses, capillary refill, blood 
pressure) and end-organ perfusion (urine output, acidosis); do NOT titrate IVI PGE based on oxygen 
saturation
• Causes of poor / non-responders
 →Non-ductal dependent lesions
 →Poor mixing in TGA
 →IV access blockade
 →Tolerance due to prolonged use
 →Non-cardiac causes of deterioration (pneumonia, PPHN, sepsis, anaemia)
• Recommended for all newborn as routine screening for critical congenital heart diseases
• Also able to detect hypoxemia due to other clinically severe conditions, such as pneumonia, persistent 
pulmonary hypertension of newborn, sepsis
Recommendation for Performing Newborn Pulse Oximetry Screening
To be done at 24 – 48 hours of life, or as late as possible if the baby is discharged before 24 hours of age.
Oxygen saturation be measured with pulse oximetry probe placed on either foot (post-ductal).
A positive result (failed screening):
•   A single reading of oxygen saturation <90%, or
•   3 readings of oxygen saturation of <95%, separated by 1 hour
Patients who fail the screening test should be assessed clinically, referred for a detailed transthoracic 
echocardiogram and considered for additional testing such as chest radiography or bloodwork

Hypercyanotic Spell 
Severe and often prolonged episodes of intense cyanosis in patients with underlying unrepaired Tetralogy of 
Fallot (may also occur in other lesions with anatomy which allow abrupt changes in the ratio of pulmonary-
to-systemic blood flow). Although the exact aetiology is unclear, it is believed to be mediated by variable 
combination of acute worsening of subpulmonic obstruction, decreased systemic vascular resistance, 
hypovolaemia and increased catecholamines resulting in severely diminished pulmonary blood flow and 
increased right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.
Treat this as a medical emergency. 
• Knee-chest/squatting position: 
 ÊPlace the baby on the mother’s lap with the knees tucked up underneath the chest. 
 ÊThis provides a calming effect, reduces systemic venous return and increases systemic vascular 
resistance. 
• Administer 100% oxygen
• Give IV/IM/SC morphine 0.1 – 0.2 mg/kg to reduce distress and hyperpnoea.  
 ÊCan be repeated once after 3 minutes if the hypercyanotic spell is ongoing
If the above measures fail: 
• IV Propranolol 0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg slow bolus over 10 mins.
• Alternatively, IV Esmolol 0.5 mg/kg slow bolus over 1 min, followed by 0.05 mg/kg/min for 4 mins.
 ÊEsmolol is an ultra-short-acting beta blocker 
 ÊCan be given as continuous IV infusion at 0.01 – 0.02 mg/kg/min. 
• Volume expander (crystalloid or colloid) 20 ml/kg rapid IV push to increase preload. 
• IV sodium bicarbonate 1 - 2 mEq/kg to correct the metabolic acidosis.  
In resistant cases, consider:
• Heavy sedation, intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
• IV Phenylephrine (0.01 – 0.02 mg/kg slow bolus) or IV Noradrenaline (0.1 – 0.5 mcg/kg/min infusion) to 
increase systemic vascular resistance and reduce right to left shunt. 
• Emergency modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenting.Clinical Presentation 
Other Notes Introduction
Management• Peak incidence age: 3 to 6 months.
• Frequently occurs in the morning; precipitated by crying, feeding or defaecation. 
• Severe cyanosis, hyperpnoea, lethargy.
• In severe cases, it may lead to loss of consciousness, hypoxic seizure and death.
• Reduced intensity of systolic murmur during the spell. 
A single episode of hypercyanotic spell is an indication for early surgical referral (either total repair or 
modified Blalock-Taussig shunt/RVOT stenting). 
Oral propranolol 0.2 – 1 mg/kg/dose 8 to 12 hourly should be started soon after stabilization while waiting 
for surgical intervention.

• Bed rest to reduce the body’s metabolic demand
• Oxygen supplementation for patients with respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation due to 
congested lungs or chest infections. 
 ÊAvoid excessive oxygen in left to right shunt lesions
• Fluid restriction to ¾ normal maintenance if not dehydrated or in shock. Aim for negative fluid balance 
if in a fluid-overloaded state
• Prompt treatment of lung infection with appropriate antibiotics
• Optimize caloric intake
 ÊTotal caloric intake as high as 150 kcal/kg/day may be required in infants with severe heart failure to 
compensate for increased energy expenditure for work of breathing. Small and frequent meals are 
preferred in older children.
 ÊIncrease caloric density by feed fortification (medium chain triglycerides, glucose polymer)
 ÊNasogastric tube feeding may be required in infants with poor suck
• Assisted ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) may be required for patients with acute respiratory 
failure either from concurrent chest infections or decompensated heart failure
Frusemide
• Dose: 1 mg/kg/dose OD to QID; continuous IV infusion at 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/hour if severely fluid 
overload
• Always use together with potassium-sparing agents (such as spironolactone or ACE inhibitors) or 
potassium supplements (1 to 2 mmol/kg/day) to prevent hypokalaemia
Captopril
• Dose: 0.1 mg/kg/dose TDS, gradually step up to 1 mg/kg/dose TDS
• Afterload reduction agent
• Monitor serum potassium and renal function. Do not use during acute decompensated heart failure
Carvedilol
• Dose: 0.1 to 0.8 mg/kg/day

Section 8         CARDIOLOGYChapter 43:
Infective Endocarditis 
Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart which frequently 
involves the heart valves. It is associated with high mortality and severe complications. Early and accurate 
diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment to improve outcomes and reduce mortality.
A high index of suspicion is warranted in any patients with underlying risk factors who present with 
unexplained fever (90%), loss of appetite and weight loss. Heart murmurs are found in up to 85% of 
patients. Some may present with complications such as heart failure (up to 58%) and embolic events (25%). 
Young infants and immunocompromised patients may not have fever.
Pre-existing risk factors:
• Congenital heart disease; whether unrepaired or repaired
• Prosthetic heart valves and intracardiac devices
• Previous history of infective endocarditis
• Native valvular heart diseases such as rheumatic heart disease
• Presence of chronic intravenous access such as indwelling central venous catheters, chemoports and 
hemodialysis catheters
• Immunocompromised patients
The diagnosis of IE requires a combination of clinical features, microbiological findings and identification of 
endocardial involvements and extracardiac complications by imaging tools. 
Blood cultures  
• Remains the cornerstone of diagnosis of IE
• At least 3 sets (to increase yield and reduce false positive rate by skin contaminants)
• There is no necessity to wait for spikes of fever (due to the continuous nature of bacteremia)
• Should be taken at 30 mins intervals between samples
• Should be obtained from peripheral veins and not from central venous catheter using aseptic technique
• Should be taken before commencement of antibiotics
• Each set should include 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottle with a minimal of 3 ml of blood
Echocardiography
• Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be performed as soon as possible when IE is suspected.
• Findings suggestive of IE include vegetation, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, new dehiscence of the 
prosthetic valve, fistula, valve leaflet perforation and aneurysm.
• The sensitivity and specificity of TTE are strongly affected by patient’s acoustic window and the 
operator’s experience.
• If clinical suspicion of IE remains high despite an initial negative TTE, a repeat TTE or transoesophageal 
echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended within a week.
• In children, TEE requires general anaesthesia and risk versus benefit must be carefully considered.
• TEE is advisable in cases with prosthetic valves, prosthetic cardiac material and those with poor TTE 
acoustic window.
• TTE is recommended at the completion of antibiotic treatment to assess treatment response.Introduction

Kawasaki Disease 
A systemic febrile syndrome with generalized vasculitis involving small to medium-sized arteries, usually 
affecting children below 5 years old.
Coronary artery aneurysm is the most important complication which carries risk of coronary artery 
thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction and death
The aetiology remains unknown; likely of infectious origin in genetically susceptible individuals
If coronary artery abnormality is evidenced on echocardiogram, diagnosis can be made with fewer than 4 
clinical criteria
Other helpful clinical features in making the diagnosis:
• Neurological: irritability, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis
• Cardiovascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, valvular regurgitation, non-coronary medium-sized artery 
aneurysms
• Gastrointestinal: diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatitis, hydrops of gallbladder, paralytic ileus
• Genitourinary: sterile pyuria, proteinuria, testicular swelling
• Skin: erythema or induration of BCG scar, perianal erythema or excoriation
• Musculoskeletal: transient arthritisDivided into 3 clinical phases
Typical Kawasaki Disease
Characterized by fever ≥ 5 days and ≥ 4 clinical criteriaIntroduction
Clinical Features
Phase Clinical features Time
Acute Fever, mucocutaneous signs 1 to 2 weeks
Subacute Defervescence, periungual desquamation, thrombocytosis, coronary 
artery aneurysm2 to 4 weeks
Convalescent Resolution of signs & symptoms, normalization of acute inflammatory 
markers4 to 8 weeks
Diagnostic Criteria for Kawasaki Disease (KD)
Fever ≥ 5 days
AND
At least 4 out of the 5 clinical criteria
1. Bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis
2. Mucosal changes of the oropharynx (injected pharynx, red lips, dry fissured lips, strawberry tongue)
3. Changes in extremities (oedema and/or erythema of the hands or feet, periungual desquamation)
4. Polymorphous rash (usually diffuse maculopapular, occasional scarlatiniform or erythema multiform-like)
5. Cervical lymphadenopathy (at least one lymph node > 1.5 cm)

Can consider the following:
• IV Amiodarone
i. Useful for resistant reentry tachycardia, atrial tachycardias (which will not respond to 
adenosine) and ‘stable’ ventricular tachycardia
ii. Dose: 25 mcg/kg/min for 4 hours then 5 – 15 mcg/kg/min
iii. More rapid administration of the loading dose can be used but there is a significant risk of 
hypotension. In children who are unstable, electrical cardioversion is a safer option
• IV Esmolol
i. Short acting, cardio selective beta-blocker
ii. Given as continuous infusion at 25 – 300 mcg/kg/min)
iii. Rarely given for > 48 hours• In non-responders, consider wrong diagnosis: sinus tachycardia (most common reason; IV 
Adenosine will result in transient slowing down of heart rate followed by acceleration back 
to previous rate), atrial flutter (appearance of flutter waves during transient slowing down 
of ventricular rate), ectopic atrial tachycardia/multifocal atrial tachycardia (continuation of 
tachycardia with AV block), ventricular or junctional tachycardia (no change of heart rate)
• Early recurrence of reentry tachycardia: sudden “jump” of heart rate following initial successful 
termination of tachycardia. Longer acting anti-arrhythmic drug is indicated (propranolol, digoxin 
or amiodarone).

Neonatal Seizures  
Seizures are the most common manifestation of neurological dysfunction in the newborn and are often 
acute and provoked by various factors (e.g. hypoxia ischemia, birth trauma). An electroclinical seizure 
features definite clinical signs simultaneously coupled with an electrographic seizure. The concept of 
electrographic-only seizures can be seen in specific cohort of patients, especially in neonatal hypoxic 
ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
Neonates may also exhibit paroxysmal non-epileptic events than can mimic seizures and it is important 
to differentiate them from the following:
a. Jitteriness-stimulus sensitive & aborts with gentle limb flexion
b. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus-only occurs in sleep & aborts with arousal
c. Startle disease (Hyperekplexia)-excessive startle, stimulus sensitive jerks and generalized muscle 
rigidity
Neonatal seizures may not fit easily into existing classification developed for older children, hence in 
2020 the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Neonatal seizure task force established specific 
guidelines for seizures in the neonatal period. Figure 1 depicts the diagnostic framework for seizures in 
the neonatal period in which the key role of EEG is emphasized. 1. Introduction

Section 9         NEUROLOGY• Thorough history, physical examination and neurophysiological assessment with amplitude 
integrated EEG (aEEG)/ continuous video electroencephalography (cEEG) is often required in 
newborns at risk for seizures. 
Video EEG is the gold standard for diagnosis of neonatal seizures. If access is limited, use aEEG with 
co-registration of raw channels
• It is very important to delineate whether the abnormal movements/paroxysmal events are seizures. 
Correlation with aEEG is desirable as this avoids unnecessary and potentially deleterious treatment 
with antiseizure medications (ASM) 
• Controversies regarding extent of treatment (i.e. whether to stop all clinical or electrographic 
seizures) exist.  EEG monitoring to evaluate seizure burden should be initiated.  A seizure burden of 
> 30-60 seconds per hour should be considered an indication to start treatment. 
• In acute setting, administer anti-seizure medication (ASM) intravenously to achieve rapid onset 
of action and predictable blood levels in order to achieve serum levels in the normal therapeutic 
range. 
• Discontinuation of ASM is safe in acute setting and no difference was found in functional 
neurodevelopment/epilepsy at 24 months among children who was discontinued vs maintained at 
hospital discharge
• A prolonged duration of ASM maintenance (6-12 weeks) following acute neonatal seizures may be 
considered in the following circumstances:
a. Higher probability of seizure recurrence (stroke & hemorrhage) 
b. Abnormal neonatal neurological examination upon discharge
c. Abnormal EEG background upon discharge
• Routine maintenance ASM is not recommended  as some ASM (phenobarbitone & phenytoin) have 
neuro-apoptotic properties. 3. Aetiology

Epilepsy  
• Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic 
seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. 
• An epileptic seizure is the transient occurrence of clinical manifestation of abnormal excessive or 
synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. 
• An epileptic syndrome is an epileptic disorder characterized by a cluster of clinical and EEG features, 
often supported by specific aetiological findings (structural, genetic, metabolic, immune and infectious). 
It has therapeutic and prognostic implications. Syndromes often have age-dependent presentations and 
a range of specific co-morbidities.
• The first important step in the management of childhood epilepsy is to differentiate epileptic seizures 
from paroxysmal non-epileptic events.• At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 h apart.
• One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general 
recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.
• Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.Definition

Notes:
• 25-50% of first unprovoked seizures in children will recur.
• The child who is neurologically normal, with no history of neurologic illness, and no evident acute cause 
for the seizure has an approximately 25% risk of a recurrent seizure in the next year, and nearly 50% risk 
of seizure over the next -3 years.
• 70-80% of second seizures will recur.

 ͳFocal seizure
 ͳSignificant brain MRI findings
 ͳAbnormal EEG
 ͳFamily history of epilepsy
• Detailed history to determine if event is a seizure or a paroxysmal non- epileptic event as 30% of 
patients referred as epilepsy do not have seizures.
• A thorough clinical examination is important to look for any possible underlying aetiology.
• Please exclude acute symptomatic causes such as metabolic, traumatic, vascular or infectious 
aetiologies.
• Distinguish between acute symptomatic seizures and epilepsy.
• Treating underlying cause of provoked seizures will usually resolve the seizures and long-term anti-
seizure medication is not required.
• EEG should not be routinely  performed after a first unprovoked generalised seizure in young children 
who are neurologically normal. 
• EEG is recommended after the second or subsequent seizure.
• Rarely required for acute symptomatic seizures.
• EEG in unprovoked seizure may help classify seizure type, epilepsy syndrome and predict recurrence.Investigations such as FBC, BUSE, Ca, Mg, RBS are indicated if
• Child unwell (vomiting, diarrhoea etc).
• Child not ‘alert’, lethargic or failure to return to baseline alertness.
• Lumbar puncture indicated if there is suspicion of brain infection.
• Toxicology screening considered if there is suspicion of drug exposure.Definition

Section 9         NEUROLOGY• Persisting postictal focal deficit (Todd’s paresis).
• Condition of child not returned to baseline within several hours after the seizure.
• Treatment with anti-seizure medication is NOT indicated in all patients with a first afebrile seizure as it 
does not prevent development of epilepsy or influence long term remission.
• However, rescue medication such as rectal diazepam may be prescribed if the unprovoked seizure was 
prolonged.
• Is it a seizure? (refer to table 1)
• Classification of seizure type/types. (refer to table 2, figure 1)
• Identification of epilepsy syndrome. 
• Determination of aetiology and assessment of co-morbidity. 
The following investigations are:
• Full blood count, biochemical investigations such as electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose, liver and 
renal function tests to exclude metabolic cause and before starting anti-seizure medication.
• Metabolic and genetic studies in clinically indicated cases with associated developmental delay where 
aetiology has not been identified.
• EEG is important to support the clinical diagnosis of epileptic seizures, classify the seizure type and 
epileptic syndrome, helps in selection of anti-seizure medication and prognosis. 
• EEG performed during sleep increases yield of abnormalities and is important for those patients with 
seizures predominantly during sleep.
• A ‘normal’ EEG does not exclude epilepsy as it is a clinical diagnosis and the yield of abnormalities from 
a single EEG recording is low. 
• Epilepsy occurring in the first year of life, except febrile seizures.
• Focal epilepsy except for the self-limited focal epilepsies list in figure 2.
• Developmental delay or regression.
• Difficult to control / refractory epilepsy.
NB. MRI is not indicated in the typical self-limited epilepsies and the genetic  generalized epilepsies
e.g. Childhood / Juvenile absence epilepsy,  Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Epilepsy with GTCS alone.• The diagnosis of epilepsy is mainly clinical.
• Detailed history of the seizures; i.e. the setting in which the seizure occurs, child’s behaviour preceding, 
during and after the event is critical
• Video (via mobile phone camera) of the actual event is helpful.
• The antenatal, birth, past medical history, developmental milestones and family history should be 
recorded meticulously.
• Look for dysmorphism, neurocutaneous signs; do thorough CNS and developmental examination.

First Line:  Valproate^, Levetiracetam
Second Line Lamotrigine, Clonazepam, Clobazam, Topiramate
^(avoid in postpubertal girls of childbearing potential)• Attempt to classify the seizure type(s) and epilepsy syndrome. 
• Treatment recommended if ≥ 2 episodes (recurrence risk up to 80%).
• Monotherapy as far as possible. 
• Choose most appropriate ASM based on epilepsy syndrome, seizure type (if epilepsy syndrome not 
identified yet) and associated comorbidities. 
• Increase dose gradually until seizures controlled or maximum dose reached or side effects occur.
• Add on the second ASM if first medication failed. Optimise second medication, then try to withdraw 
first medication. (Alternative monotherapy).
• Rational combination therapy (usually 2 or maximum of 3 ASM) 
i.e. combine ASM with different mechanism of action and consider their spectrum of efficacy, 
interactions and adverse effects.
• Beware of ASM-induced seizure aggravation in certain epilepsy syndromes.
• Trial of vitamins and co-factors such as vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate, biotin and folinic acid should 
be considered in infantile epilepsies not responding to ASM. 
• Risk of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions, including Steven-Johnson syndrome and 
toxic epidermal necrolysis, is increased in patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele – ideally testing prior to 
starting Carbamazepine is recommended.
• Valproate should be avoided if there is clinical suspicion of an underlying neurometabolic disorder or a 
progressive illness where the underlying aetiology has not been ascertained yet, especially in children < 
2years, due to risk of hepatotoxicity.
• Avoid the use of Valproate in postpubertal girls of childbearing potential because of its teratogenic risks. 
• Drug level monitoring is not routinely  done (except phenytoin), unless non-compliance, toxicity or drug 
interaction is suspected.
• Vitamin D supplementation should be considered for children with risk factors for Vitamin D deficiency, 
i.e. those on long term ASM, or on more than 1 ASM and poor sunlight exposure.
• When withdrawal of medication is planned (generally after being seizure free for 2 years), consider the 
underlying epilepsy syndrome, likely prognosis and individual circumstances before attempting slow 
withdrawal of medication over 3-6 months (duration of weaning maybe longer if using phenobarbitone 
or benzodiazepine). 
• If seizures recur, the last dose reduction is reversed and patient should be re-evaluated.

First Aid Measures during a Seizure (Advice for Parents / Teachers)
• Do not panic, remain calm. Note time of onset of the seizure.
• Loosen the child’s clothing especially around the neck.
• Place the child in a left lateral position with the head lower than the body.
• Wipe any vomitus or secretions from the mouth.
• Do not insert any object into the mouth even if the teeth are clenched.
• Do not give any fluids or drugs orally (unless using buccal Midazolam to abort seizure).
• Stay near the child until the seizure is over and comfort the child as he/she is recoveringAdvice for ParentsWhen to refer to Paediatric Neurologist? The patients with “Intractable Epilepsy” 
• Educate and counsel on epilepsy.
• Emphasize compliance if on anti-seizure medication.
• Don’t stop the medication without doctor’s advice as this may precipitate breakthrough seizures.
• Avoid sleep deprivation.
• Use a shower with bathroom door unlocked.
• Avoid cycling in traffic, climbing sports or swimming alone.
• Educate on the emergency treatment of seizures.
• Inform teachers and school about the condition.Please re-evaluate for the following possibilities: -
• Is it a seizure or a non-epileptic event? 
• Wrong classification of epilepsy syndrome, thus wrong choice of antiseizure medication. 
• Anti-seizure medication doses not optimised. 
• Poor compliance to anti-seizure medication. 
• Anti-seizure medication aggravating seizures. 
• Lesional epilepsy, hence a potential epilepsy surgery candidate. 
• Progressive epilepsy or neurodegenerative disorder. 
• Infantile spasms  
• Behavioural or developmental regression. 
• Poor seizure control despite monotherapy with 2 different anti-seizure medications. 
• Difficult to control epilepsies beginning in the first two years of life. 
• Structural lesion on neuroimaging.Intractable Epilepsy is defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen anti-
seizure medication schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure 
freedom.

Status Epilepticus: Management Of Convulsive Status Eilepticus  
• Definition of convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is a seizure that continues for greater than 5min.
• After 5min, seizures are unlikely to terminate spontaneously.
• The risk of seizure becoming refractory increases with increasing seizure duration.
• Therefore, treatment should be started once seizure has lasted >5min.
• T1 and T2 are two important operational time points in the conceptional definition of SE.
• Out of hospital administration of benzodiazepine shows clear benefit due to earlier abolished SE.
• Educating parents/caregiver & EMS on the use of rescue medication, first aid and recovery position is 
important.
• *Administration of the entire recommended dose of benzodiazepine in the initial treatment is more 
efficacious than multiple small doses. 
• The efficacy of benzodiazepine decreases 20-fold over 30min of SE.
• *Quickly escalate to non-benzodiazepine 2nd line ASM once failed 2 doses of benzodiazepine.
• Three large RCTs have found equal potency for Phenytoin, Levetiracetam and Sodium Valproate.
• Children who have frequent seizures/under the pediatric neurology follow up usually have an 
individually tailored guideline. “Ask the parent for follow-up book.”
• There is no evidence of ideal 3rd line agent: thiopentone, propofol, ketamine and midazolam.
• However midazolam is the safest in pediatric age group.
• Other investigation at the refractory stage: CT/MRI/Autoimmune screen/metabolic & genetic studies 
accordingly.
• Do not forget to look hard for underlying etiology and treat accordingly.
• Often maintenance dose is forgotten.
• In sepsis, monitor calcium and magnesium levels, as they can be low.
• Monitor glucose, aim for 4-8mmol/L.
• Measure serum sodium and treat if < 125mmol/L ( 3ml kg 3% sodium chloride)
• Consider temperature control if hyperthermic.
• Consider meningitis, encephalitis, raised ICP .
• Consider TBI if signs of trauma.• Avoid valproate if suspected inborn error of metabolism or liver dysfunction.
• Avoid phenytoin in Dravet Syndrome.
• Do not give phenytoin too rapidly as it can cause bradycardia/asystole.• T1 is the at time point at which treatment should be started. 
• Beyond this point if seizures continue, it is termed continuous seizure activity.
• T2 is the time point at which seizures should have terminated.  Beyond which long term complications

Febrile Seizures  
• Seizures occurring in association with fever in children between 6 months and 5 years of age, in whom 
there is no evidence of intracranial pathology or metabolic derangement.
• No comprehensive local epidemiological data. Studies in Western countries quote a figure of 2-5% of 
children < 5 years experiencing febrile seizures.
• Not all children need hospital admission. The main reasons for admission are: -
• To exclude intracranial pathology especially infection.
• Fear of recurrent seizures.
• To investigate and treat the cause of fever besides meningitis /encephalitis.
• To allay parental anxiety, especially if they are staying far from hospital.
• Investigations
• The need for blood counts, blood sugar, lumbar puncture, urinalysis, chest X-ray, blood culture etc, 
will depend on clinical assessment of the individual case.
• Lumbar puncture
Must be done if:  (unless contraindicated - see Chapter on Meningitis)
 ͳAny symptoms or signs suggestive of intracranial infection
 ͳPersistent lethargy and not fully interactive
Should be considered if:
 ͳAge < 12 months old especially if child has not received Hib and pneumococcal immunization
 ͳPrior antibiotic therapy
• Serum calcium and electrolytes are rarely necessary.
• EEG is not indicated even if multiple recurrences or complex febrile seizures.
• Parents should be counselled on the benign nature of the condition.
• Control fever
• Avoid excessive clothing
• Use antipyretic e.g. syrup or rectal Paracetamol 15 mg/kg 6 hourly for patient’s comfort, though this 
does not reduce the risk of seizure recurrence.
• Parents should also be advised on First Aid Measures during a Seizure .
Rectal Diazepam
• Parents of children with high risk of recurrent febrile seizures including those with febrile status

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 9         NEUROLOGY• Prevention of recurrent febrile seizures.
Antiseizure medications are not recommended for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures because:
• The risks and potential side effects of medications outweigh the benefit.
• No medication has been shown to prevent the future onset of epilepsy.
• Febrile seizures have an excellent outcome with no neurological deficit nor any effect on 
intelligence.
Risk factors for Recurrent Febrile Seizures
• Family history of Febrile seizures
• Age < 18 months
• Low degree of fever (< 40oC) during first febrile seizure.
• Brief duration (< 1 hr) between onset of fever and seizure.
* If No risk factor, then < 15 % risk of recurrence
If ≥ 2 risk factors, then > 30 % risk of recurrence
If ≥ 3 risk factors, then > 60 % risk of recurrence
Risk factors for subsequent Epilepsy
• Neurodevelopmental abnormality
• Complex febrile seizures
• Family history of epilepsy
Prognosis in Febrile Seizures
Febrile seizures are benign events with excellent prognosis
• 2 - 5 % of population have febrile seizures.
• 30 % recurrence after 1st attack.

These disorders consist of monophasic and polyphasic (recurrent) diseases with acquired immune/antibody 
mediated injury to the white matter in the central nervous system, optic nerve or spinal cord 
• Acute visual loss (unilateral/bilateral), central scotoma or reduced visual fields, impaired colour vision 
often accompanied by painful eye movement.
• Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD +ve) and optic disc swelling may be present.
• MRI may show optic nerve swelling +/- optic nerve sheet inflammation. 
• Visual evoked potentials (VEP) will reveal evidence of pre-chiasmatic optic pathway abnormalities and 
optical coherence tomography (OCT) may be abnormal due to axonal nerve damage.
• Acute onset of encephalopathy (behavioural change or altered consciousness) with multifocal 
neurological deficits/signs
i.e. limb weakness, numbness, cerebellar ataxia, cranial nerve palsy speech, impairment, visual loss, 
seizures and spinal cord involvement.
• MRI will show multiple areas of abnormal signal intensities in the white matter.
• No other aetiologies can explain the clinical presentation and neuroimaging findings.• Acute onset of motor and sensory deficits, often bilateral and include a sensory level with bowel and 
bladder dysfunction.

Acute Flaccid Paralysis  
Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) occurs when there is rapid evolution of motor weakness (< than 4 days), with a 
loss of tone in the paralysed limb. This excludes weakness due to trauma and spastic paralysis.
AFP is a  medical emergency  as unnecessary delays can result in death and disability. Children with AFP need 
to be assessed and managed carefully. A simple algorithm is provided on the next page.
• Collection of stools for enterovirus in children with AFP is an important part of the Global Polio 
Eradication Initiative (GPEI).
• For Malaysia to remain a polio-free country we need to prove that none of our cases of AFP are caused 
by poliovirus infection. To do this we have to report all cases of AFP aged < 15 years, send stools for 
enterovirus isolation using a standardised protocol, and follow up children with AFP to determine the 
outcome.Introduction

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 9         NEUROLOGYGuillain Barré syndrome (GBS) is a post-infectious inflammatory disorder affecting the peripheral nerves.
The principle of management is to establish the diagnosis and anticipate / pre-empt major complications.
• A Clinical  diagnosis can be made by a history of progressive, ascending weakness (< 4 weeks) with 
areflexia, and an elevated CSF protein level and normal cell count (“protein-cellular dissociation”).
• Nerve conduction study is Confirmatory.
• Give oxygen, keep NBM if breathless. Monitor PEFR regularly
• Admit for PICU / PHDW care, if having:
• Respiratory compromise (deteriorating PERF).
• Rapidly progressive tetraparesis with loss of head control.
• Bulbar palsy.
• Autonomic and cardiovascular instability.
• Provide respiratory support early with BiPAP or mechanical ventilationIntroduction
Management
Initial measuresGuillain Barré Syndrome
Clinical Pearls on GBS in Children
• Rapidly progressive, bilateral and relatively symmetric weakness of the limbs with decrease or absent 
reflexes. In atypical cases, weakness may begin in the face or upper limbs, or asymmetrical at onset.
• Sensory symptoms, e.g. limb pain and hyperesthesia, are common.
• Bladder and bowel involvement may occasionally be seen, but is never present at onset and never 
persistent.
(if so, think of spinal cord disorder)
• CSF protein level and nerve conduction studies may be normal in the first week of illness.
• GBS variants and overlapping syndrome:
• Miller Fisher syndrome - cranial nerve variant characterised by opthalmoplegia, ataxia and 
areflexia.
• Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis - acute encephalopathy with cranial and peripheral nerve 
involvement.

simpler.
• 10 % of children with GBS may suffer a relapse of symptoms in the first weeks after improvement from 
IVIG. These children, may benefit from a second dose of IVIG.
• Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis should be considered for patients ventilated for GBS, especially if

Approach To The Child With Altered Consciousness  
Definition:  Altered consciousness is any measure of arousal other than normal. There is a wide range 
of presentation that includes lethargy, confusion, somnolence, obtundation, stupor and coma . This is 
considered an acute neurological emergency  characterised by significant brain impairment, necessitating a 
rapid and methodical approach to evaluation and treatment.
Check ABCD – Airway, Breathing, Circulation, check capillary glucose. 
Monitor HR, BP , respiratory Rate, SpO 2, urine output.
• Consider intubation if airway compromised.
• Give O 2 if SpO 2<95%.
• IV fluid boluses 10ml/kg if signs of shock.
• Correct hypoglycaemia if capillary glucose <3mmol/L.
Use AVPU (A=alert, V=response to verbal, P=response to pain, U= unresponsive) or Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) modified for children.
• Consider intubation if no response to Pain, or GCS <8 and not improving.
• If GCS < 12 monitor ¼ hourly till improves.
• If GCS >12 monitor hourly.Introduction

Increased ICP is likely if clinically has papilloedema  (may not be seen in hyperacute increased ICP), or if 2 of 
the following ( signs of brain herniation ):
1. GCS < 8, or deteriorating GCS 
2. Non-reactive, unequal pupils 
3. Abnormal doll’s eye reflex 
4. Decorticate, decerebrate posturing 
5. Abnormal breathing - Cheyne-Stokes, hyperventilation or irregular/gasping breathing.
In infants, check for tense fontanelle. Papilloedema is rare in infants.
The presence of increased ICP or signs of brain herniation necessitates intubation.
Other consideration for intubation:
• Airway compromised by obstruction or vomiting.
• Poor respiratory effort.
• SpO 2<92% despite high flow O 2
• Signs of shock persist after 40ml/kg of fluid bolusesRecognition of Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Other Indications for

ingestion of medications, presence of any medications in the child ‘s home, any infant deaths in the family, 
duration of symptoms.
Treat the concurrent condition and underlying causes e.g. shock, sepsis, seizures, hypoglycaemia, 
electrolyte imbalance.
General measures:  Nursing Position head in the midline. Elevate head of bed up to 15-30⁰. Avoid 
unnecessary suction and procedures. Avoid hyper or hypothermia. Avoid internal jugular central venous 
line. Adequate sedation and analgesia. Do not lower high BP unless hypertensive crisis or in acute 
glomerulonephritis.
 
Ventilation:  Maintain good oxygenation, normocapnia (PaCO₂ 35 - 40 mmHg). Avoid excessively high PEEP . 
Fluid and electrolyte:  Keep patient well hydrated. Avoid hypo-osmolar fluid or plain dextrose solutions. 
Monitor serum sodium and respond accordingly: 
• ↓sodium, ↓urine output: Consider SIADH →fluid restriction. 
• ↓sodium, ↑urine output: Consider cerebral salt wasting → replace renal sodium loss. 
• ↑sodium, polyuria (> 5ml/kg/h):  likely central diabetes insipidus → Fluid replacement and consider 
desmopressin. 
 
Hyperosmolar therapy  Consider IV mannitol or hypertonic saline.
• IV Mannitol 0.25 - 0.5 g/kg. May repeat after 2-6 hour. Avoid prolonged use > 72 hours.
• Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) 5-10 ml/kg. May repeat 2 ml/kg after 2-6 hours or infusion at 0.1-1.0 ml/kg/
hr. Recommended in hypotension but avoid in severe hyponatraemia. 
Both agents can be used concurrently but keep serum osmolality < 320 mmol/L. 
 
Surgical decompression:  When medical measures fail, surgical decompression may be indicated such as 
external ventricular drainage or decompressive hemicraniectomy.Assessment for Underlying Aetiology

• Resuscitation: Airway, Breathing , Circulation
• Admit to ICU if indicated for close vital signs and GCS monitoring
       (post-infarction cerebral oedema may worsen 2-4 days after acute stroke)
• Workup for the underlying risk factor(s) and treat accordingly
• Acute neuro-protective care:
• General measures of ICP control 
• Maintain normothermia, normoglycemia, normovolemia, good BP (50th-95th centile), adequate 
oxygenation and acceptable CO 2
• Monitor fluid & acid-base balance and treat seizures aggressively
• Decompressive surgery: to consider in malignant MCA infarction or large cerebellar infarction
• Acute Anti-thrombotic therapy:
• Consult paediatric neurologist (and haematologist if available) for the necessity, choice and 
monitoring of anti-thrombotic therapy. If stroke due to cardiac disease/procedure/operation, 
should also consult cardiologist and/or cardio-thoracic surgeon.
• If no contraindications (see below), anti-thrombotic is generally advised to prevent recurrence 
(except neonatal AIS). During the initial stage, to consider aspirin or anti-coagulation therapy (ACT) - 
either UFH or LMWH ACT is preferred in stroke due to cardiac or thrombophilic causes. 
• Recanalization therapy: (thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy)
• Not readily available in the local setting yet, may be helpful in certain paediatric patients who fulfill 
stringent criteria 
• Secondary preventive therapy:
• Aspirin : initially 3-5mg/kg/day (max 300mg), reduced to 1mg/kg/day (max 75mg) after 14 days of 
stroke onset or if having side effects
Duration: at least 2 years but may be longer (case by case basis). Caution with long-term aspirin. (See 
below)
• Alternatively, LMWH or warfarin may be preferred in the presence of intracardiac clots, major 
cardiac disease, severe prothrombotic  disorders and extra-cranial dissection (controversial)
• Other therapies: revascularization surgery in Moyamoya, immunotherapy in CNS vasculitis etc Management
Possible contraindications of anti-thrombotic therapy
Infarction associated with significant hemorrhage
Large infarction with the worry of secondary  haemorrhagic  transformation
Uncontrolled hypertension
Pre-existing bleeding tendency or any risk of significant bleeding

Infection-related Encephalopathies of Childhood  
Acute onset of impaired consciousness ± seizures, usually during the febrile period or after an antecedent 
infection.
Not due to direct CNS infection, toxic or metabolic disturbance and demyelinating process (ADEM). 
FIRES  (Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome):
• Focal (especially orofacial) or generalised seizures, leading to refractory status epilepticus, preceded by 
fever 24 hours to 2 weeks prior to onset of status epilepticus. 
• EEG characteristically shows clusters of clinical and electrographic seizures, often with hemispheric 
shifting patterns. 
• Neuroimaging mostly normal, CSF may show pleocytosis only.
HHES  (Hemiconvulsion Hemiplegia Epilepsy Syndrome - Figure 1): 
• Fever and prolonged focal/hemi-convulsive status epilepticus, complicated by hemiplegia & epilepsy 
(often drug resistant)
• Neuroimaging: cytotoxic oedema on brain MRI in the acute stage and later hemispheric atrophy.
• May have underlying structural (e.g. subtle dysplasia) or genetic (e.g. HNRNPU mutation) abnormalities
ANE  (Acute Necrotising Encephalopathy - Figure 2):  
• Acute encephalopathy +/- seizures following viral illness (most commonly influenza A), associated 
with shock and multiple organ injury, and laboratory abnormalities such as elevated liver enzymes, 
hypoglycemia, and lactic acidosis,  suggestive of a systemic inflammatory response. 
• Neuroimaging: CT-scan (bilateral thalamic hypodensity), typical “target-like appearance” / “tricolour 
pattern” in MRI brain 
• Most ANE are sporadic. Rarely familial ANE (ANE1) are due to a genetic abnormality (RANBP2) 
• Differentials: Japanese encephalitis, Leigh disease, Deep venous thrombosis, biotin / thiamine 
responsive basal ganglia disease1. “Cytokine storm” eg : IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, resulting in neuronal injury 
2. Neuronal excitotoxicity and prolonged or repetitive seizures, inducing a cyclical cascade of inflammation

304 305
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 9         NEUROLOGYWhen to suspect?  
• Any children with encephalopathy ± seizures in the context of febrile illness / infection (either during or 
at the convalescent phase of the illness)
• Evidence of hepatopathy, coagulopathy or acute systemic inflammatory response
• After excluding CNS infection, metabolic  / toxic aetiologies, inflammatory disease (e.g.: multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome-MISC), autoimmune or acquired demyelinating disorder 
Investigations :
• CT brain may be normal (except ANE). Ideally, need MRI brain with DWI/ADC + contrast. 
• Blood tests - FBC, LFT, renal profile, coagulation profile, CK, LDH, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, cytokine 
profile (if available)
• Infection screen (blood/CSF/nasal swab +/- other viral screen) to look for viral triggers or concomitant 
infection
• Consider screening for autoimmune encephalitis or systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE) 
• Urgent EEG in selected cases (discuss with paediatric neurologist)
Management :
• Aggressive treatment of seizures and status epilepticus (following guidelines), although iv 
phenobarbitone tends to be a more effective 2nd line anti-seizure medication.
• Management of encephalopathy - consider early referral to PICU team and appropriate cerebral 
protection strategies (following guidelines) 
• First line immunotherapy ( IV methylprednisolone or IVIG) should be commenced as soon as possible, 
once CNS infection is ruled out or presumptively treated, preferably in consultation with a paediatric 
neurologist. Recent anecdotal reports - IV tocilizumab may be helpful in ANE / FIRES. AESD  (Acute Encephalopathy with Biphasic Seizures and Late Reduced Diffusion - Figure 3):   
• Acute febrile status (>30 min) and altered sensorium, followed by transient improvement before 
clusters of ‘secondary’ seizures between days 3-9 and worsening encephalopathy (not all may have this 
biphasic pattern)
• Neuroimaging is characteristic, with normal MRI at onset, then symmetric, white matter restricted 
diffusion (best seen on DWI/ADC) seen during secondary seizure stage  
RESLES  (Reversible Splenial Lesion Syndrome - Figure 4) also known as Mild Encephalopathy with Reversible 
Splenial Lesion - MERS    
• Self-limiting syndrome characterised by mild encephalopathy +/- seizures following an infection 
(influenza, rotavirus, HHV6, SARS-CoV etc.); other presentation - delirium, ataxia, headache etc. 
• Neuroimaging: characteristic lesion of restricted diffusion over the splenium of the corpus callosum, 
occasionally involving cerebral white matter; lesion often resolves in 2-6 weeks.
• Usually good outcome

Approach to Short Stature  
• Definitions of growth failure: 
• Height below 3rd percentile (-2 standard deviation (SD) for age and gender). 
• Height significantly below genetic potentials (-2 SD or 10 cm below mid-parental  target). 
• Abnormally slow growth velocity. 
• Downwardly crossing percentile channels on growth chart (for children above 18 months of age). 
• Average height velocity at different phases: 
• Prenatal growth : 1.2 -1.5 cm per week 
• Infancy : 23 - 28 cm per year 
• Childhood : 5 - 6.5 cm per year 
• Puberty : 8.3 cm per year (girls), 9.5 cm per year (boys) 
• Measure serial heights to assess the growth pattern and height velocity. 
• General tests:  
• FBC with differentials, renal profile, liver function test, calcium, phosphate, blood gas analysis, ESR, 
Urinalysis. 
• Chromosomal analysis in every short girl, and in boys when chromosomal abnormality is suspected
• Endocrine tests  
• Thyroid function tests. 
• Growth factors: IGF-1 (IGFBP-3 if available) 
• Growth hormone stimulation tests if growth hormone deficiency is strongly suspected. (Refer to a 
Paediatric Endocrine Centre)Short stature can be a sign of disease, disability and social stigma causing psychological stress. 
The objective of evaluation of a child with short stature is to determine whether there is a primary growth 
disorder and identify an underlying chronic disorder (secondary growth disorder) which needs treating.
It is important to have early diagnosis and treatment in order to achieve improved clinical outcomes
1. Children with intrauterine growth retardation (small for gestational age) who do not catch up to the 
growth curve by 2 years of age 
2. Height more than 3 SD below the mean for age (Height 2 SD below the mean is slightly below 3rd 
centile on the percentile chart)
3. Growth velocity less than 4 cm  per year between age 5 to prepubertal years
4. Projected height more than 2 standard deviations (10 cm) below the midparental height 
5. No onset of puberty by 14 years of age for boys or 13 years of age for girls

• GH dose: 0.025 - 0.05 mg/kg/day (0.5 - 1.0 units/kg/wk) SC daily at night. 
• GH treatment should start with low doses and be titrated according to clinical response, side effects, 
and growth factor levels. 
• During GH treatment, patients should be monitored at 3-monthly intervals (may be more frequent at 
initiation and during dose titration) with a clinical assessment (growth parameters, compliance) and an 
evaluation for adverse effects (e.g. impaired glucose tolerance, carpal tunnel syndrome), IGF-1 level, 
and other parameters of GH response. 
• Other biochemical evaluations: 
• Thyroid function 
• HbA1c 
• Lipid profile 
• Fasting blood glucose

• Thyroid dysgenesis (60 — 70%) — due to thyroid gland development anomaly 
• Athyreosis, hypoplasia, thyroid ectopia, hemiagenesis  
• Thyroid dyshormogenesis (30 — 40%) — due to impaired thyroid hormone production 
• Sodium-iodide symporter defect, thyroid peroxidase defects 
• Resistance to TSH binding or signalling 
• Central hypothyroidism 
• Isolated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency
• Part of combined pituitary hormone deficiency 
• Peripheral hypothyroidism 
• Resistance to thyroid hormone, abnormalities of thyroid hormone transport 
• Syndromic hypothyroidism e.g. Pendred syndrome 
• Transient congenital hypothyroidism 
• CH screening using cord blood has been the practice in Malaysia since its implementation in 2003.1 
• Primary TSH measurement supplemented by free thyroxine (FT4) is the preferred strategy. 
• Interpretation of cord blood TSH levels and subsequent actions are summarised in Figure 1.  
• The recall should be done after 72 hours of life, usually by day 4 — 6. This is due to postnatal surge in 
TSH occurs within 30 minutes of life, followed by FT4 that peak at 24 — 36 hours of life, and then a 
rapid decline to reach a steady state only after 72 hours. 
• The recall should include patients whose cord blood TSH was not available, as in home deliveries, 
babies born before arrival (BBA) and rejected blood samples etc.• This chapter is based on recent Consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of 
congenital hypothyroidism in Malaysia.1 
• Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the commonest congenital endocrine disorder and also the most 
preventable cause for mental retardation.
• The incidence of CH is ranging from 1 in 1170 to 3666 live births based on local studies.

*Beware that majority of newborns with CH do not manifest clinical features at birth until 3 — 6 
months later. 
• Obtain history of risk factors for CH (maternal history of thyroid disease; use of anti-thyroid drug; 
excessive iodine intake e.g. seaweed; maternal iodine deficiency; parental consanguinity; family history 
of thyroid disease; prematurity; low birth weight infant; use of iodine antiseptic solutions).
• Other physical examinations include:
• Growth parameters
• Dysmorphic features
• Features of pituitary hormones deficiency (central hypothyroidism) 
• Congenital malformation e.g. facial midline defect (cleft lip, cleft palate, nasal encephalocele), 
cardiac abnormality particularly atrial and ventricular septal defects, urogenital abnormalities. 
• The venous TFT at Day 4-6 is confirmatory in most cases for diagnosis of CH. Please refer to figure 2  for 
interpretation and recommendation of actions. For some special categories of babies, please refer to 
section on  Special Categorie s. 
• FT4 and TSH should not be interpreted in isolation of each other. 
• The suggested thresholds of FT4 in the recommendations are based on expert opinion and only to 
serve as a guide. An elevated TSH is often the primary determinant in deciding treatment for  primary  
hypothyroidism. 
• In some cases where the results are equivocal, a decision to repeat the test and monitor is a reasonable 
option after discussion with the parents.Clinical evaluation

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGY• Treatment should be started as soon as diagnosis is made. Treatment initiation within 2 weeks of life 
had shown restoration to near-normal IQ in moderate and severe CH. 
• Levothyroxine (LT4) is the treatment of choice for CH. A brand LT4 rather than a generic formulation is 
recommended.
• An initial dose of LT4 at 10-15 mcg/kg/day (maximum 50 mcg/day) is recommended, the lowest dose 
for mild disease and higher dose for severe disease.
• Mild CH (FT4 > 10 pmol/L)                    10 mcg/kg/day 
• Moderate CH (FT4 5–10 pmol/L)         10 mcg/kg/day
• Severe CH (FT4 <5 pmol/L)                   15 mcg/kg/day
• Subclinical CH                                          5-10 mcg/kg/day 
• LT4 should be administered orally in tablet form. LT4 in suspension or syrup form is not recommended. 
• LT4 tablets can be crushed, mixed in small amount of water or milk, and served using a spoon. LT4 
should not be served in a milk-bottle. 
• LT4 is administered in a single daily dose and at a consistent timing every day to ensure compliance. It 
is recommended to take the medication in the morning upon awakening for all ages (expert consensus 
opinion). 
• LT4 can be taken before, with or after food. However, intake of soy, iron or calcium supplementation 
within an hour of LT4 administration should be avoided.
• Serum FT4 and TSH should be measured before, or at least 4 hours after the last LT4 administration. 
• Frequency of TFT monitoring:
• After initiation of LT4, the first clinical and biochemical follow-up should be 1-2 weeks later. If the 
initial dose of LT4 is close to 15 mcg/kg/ day or 50 mcg/day, follow-up should be within 1 week of 
treatment initiation.
• Subsequent clinical and biochemical evaluation should be every 2 weeks until TSH normalises. 
• Thereafter, the evaluation can be reduced to every 1 to 3 months until the age of 12 months. 
• Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, the frequency of evaluations can be lowered to every 2 to 4 
months; thereafter, every 3 to 6 months until growth is completed. 
• TSH normalises slower compared to FT4. The aim is to achieve normalisation of FT4 within 2 weeks of 
treatment, followed by normalisation of TSH within 4 weeks of treatment.
• Serum concentration of TSH should be kept within the age-specific reference range and FT4 in the 
upper half of the age-specific reference range. Over-suppression of TSH to <0.5 mIU/L should be 
avoided. 
• FT4 and TSH should be interpreted together in deciding adjustment of LT4 dose. 
• Evaluations should be performed at more frequent intervals if there is abnormal FT4 or TSH level, or if 
compliance is questioned. 
• After any change in LT4 dose or LT4 formulation, extra follow-up evaluations should be done 4 to 6 
weeks later until FT4 and TSH are normalised. 
• Monitoring for  long term outcomes  includes: 
• Psychomotor and speech development
• Hearing test before school age 
• Growth and puberty
• Compliance to treatment, which is important to future cardiovascular health and pregnancy 
outcome.Treatment

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 10        ENDOCRINOLOGY• All babies treated for CH will need to be re-evaluated to determine if the CH is permanent or transient 
and to establish a possible aetiology. 
• Re-evaluation is done at or after 3 years of age when myelination in the central nervous system is 
complete.4 
• At re-evaluation, LT4 is stopped for 4 weeks or phased out over 4-6 weeks. At the end of this period, 
venous FT4 and TSH are measured:
• If FT4 & TSH are within the normal reference range — LT4 replacement is discontinued and 
TFT monitored for the next 6 months. If TFT remains normal after 6 months, the patient can be 
discharged. 
• If TSH is >10mIU/L — this likely indicates permanent CH. LT4 replacement is resumed, and the 
patient continues regular follow-up. 
• If TSH is <10 mIU/L, but more than upper limit of reference range and FT4 normal — withhold 
LT4 treatment for another 3-4 weeks and FT4 & TSH are re-tested. Long term LT4 replacement is 
indicated if there is structural abnormality of the thyroid gland, or TSH increases to >10 mIU/L, or 
FT4 falls to below the reference range for age, or there are symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. 
• Early re-evaluation can be done at or after the age of 6 months in a CH child who has been known to 
have a gland-in-situ (GIS), and requires a low thyroxine dose of less than 3 mcg/kg/day at the age of 6 
months, as they are likely to have a transient form of CH.
• Re-evaluation may not be required if venous TSH has been persistently >10 mIU/L after 1 year of age 
despite thyroxine replacement, as this most likely indicates a permanent form of CH. 
• In patient confirmed to have permanent form of CH at re-evaluation, thyroid ultrasonography is useful 
to determine the presence, location and anatomy of the thyroid gland. However, its accuracy is operator 
dependent.
• Thyroid scintigraphy may also be considered as it is a more reliable imaging modality to determine the 
aetiology of CH, especially in thyroid ectopia and certain cases of dyshormonogenesis.
The following groups of neonates are at high risk for later development of congenital hypothyroidism 
post-screening. Even though they may have a normal screening tests, it is recommended to have their TFT 
repeated.1 
• Sick neonates  
• Include newborns with perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, those who require respiratory or cardiovascular 
support, or have undergone major surgical procedures. 
• To repeat at 2 weeks after recovery from acute illness.
• Preterm infants below 37 weeks gestation / low birth weight below 2.5kg
• For late preterms who are not admitted or have a short stay in hospital, TFT should be repeated 2 
weeks after initial screening. This may be done as outpatient or at the Maternal and Child Health 
Clinic (MCHC) nearest to their homes. 
• For those who have prolonged stay in hospital, TFT should be repeated at 2 weekly interval until 
discharge and 2 weeks post discharge. In hospital with neonatologists or paediatrician, the interval 
to repeat these tests can be based on the clinical judgement and discretion of attending specialists. 
• LT4 therapy of isolated hypothyroxinaemia without clear elevation of TSH is not recommended. 
• Down syndrome  
• TFT should be repeated at 3-4 weeks of life, even if the newborn screening result is normal. 
• Multiple births  
• Re-testing of TFT should be done in monozygotic twins at 14 days of life. Due to mixing of foetal 
blood, the affected infant may not be detected by the initial newborn screening. Re-evaluation of thyroid function in congenital hypothyroidism

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGY• Infant of mother with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD)  
• TFT to be repeated at day 4 – 6 and at day 10 – 14 of life. 
• As the transplacental maternal autoantibodies persist for 3 — 6 months in the affected babies, 
newborns treated for CH due to maternal AITD should be monitored for at least 6 months. The dose 
of LT4 should be titrated against the TFT and tapered accordingly. 
• Congenital central hypothyroidism (CCH)
• Our TSH-based neonatal screening for CH will miss CCH where TSH is inappropriately low with a 
low FT4. CCH is much rarer compared to congenital primary hypothyroidism, but delayed diagnosis 
and treatment will result in severe consequences as well. Besides, majority of CCH (74-84%) is also 
associated with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. 
• Newborns with the following features are at risk of CCH: 
• Facial mid-line defect e.g. cleft palate or cleft lip, nasal encephalocoele
• Symptoms and signs of pituitary hormones deficiency in a neonate e.g. intractable 
hypoglycaemia, prolonged cholestatic jaundice, micropenis 
• Ocular abnormality e.g. optic nerve hypoplasia 
• All newborns at risk of CCH should be recalled for re-test of venous FT4 and TSH at day 4-6, 
regardless of their initial screening results, and followed up accordingly.
• Newborns with symptoms and signs suggestive of pituitary hormone deficiencies should have 
FT4 and TSH checked, in addition to other pituitary hormones. 
• In babies with CCH and concomitant ACTH deficiency, adequate glucocorticoid replacement 
should precede LT4 treatment to prevent adrenal crisis. 
• The starting dose of LT4 is the same as in primary hypothyroidism. Treatment is monitored by 
measuring FT4 and TSH and aim to keep FT4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference 
range.

Diabetes Mellitus  
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is the most common type of diabetes mellitus in children and 
adolescents. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is on the rising trend among adolescents 
due to obesity. 
• Monogenic diabetes or MODY is a familial form of diabetes that usually presents with a mild, non-
ketotic diabetes presenting during adolescence or early adulthood. 
• Neonatal diabetes should be suspected in infants less than 1 year old. 
• Regardless of the type of diabetes, any child with severe hyperglycemia, ketonemia and metabolic 
abnormalities will initially require insulin therapy.
• The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents should be made based on clinical 
features and biochemical criteria (Refer Table 2: World Health Organization diagnostic criteria*). 
• Autoantibodies testing (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, anti-islet antibody, insulin autoantibodies 
and protein tyrosine phosphatase antibody, (other autoantibodies may be done if available) to confirm 
the diagnosis of T1DM 
• The diagnosis must be confirmed by repeat blood glucose testing in the absence of unequivocal 
hyperglycaemia. 
• The role of HbA1c alone in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus remains unclear and diabetes cannot be 
excluded when the value is <6.5%. Introduction

• Daily insulin dosage varies between individuals and changes over time.  
• The basal-bolus regimen (intermediate-acting insulin/long-acting basal once or twice daily and rapid-
acting/short-acting boluses with meals and snacks) mimics the physiological insulin secretion. 
• Basal insulin constitutes about 30 - 50% of the total daily insulin dose (TDD) requirements; the 
remainder is pre-prandial rapid-acting or short- acting insulin. 
• Insulin pump therapy /continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) offers flexibility, better metabolic 
control and improvement in quality of life without the need for multiple insulin injections. In toddlers, 
pump is a preferred method whenever affordable and expertise available.• During the honeymoon period (partial remission phase) total daily insulin dose is usually 0.5 IU/kg/day 
or less
• Prepubertal children (outside the partial remission phase) usually require insulin of 0.7–1.0 IU/kg/day.
• During puberty, requirements may rise to 1 - 2 IU/kg/day.Management

• For patients with T1DM on basal bolus therapy, pre-meal insulin dose may be adjusted based on insulin 
to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) or insulin sensitivity factor (ISF). 
• Insulin dose adjustments according to glucose trends by SMBG or CGM are important.
• ICR is defined as the amount of carbohydrate in grams covered by one unit (IU) of rapid-acting or short-
acting insulin. 
• It can be calculated by using the 500 (for rapid-acting insulin), and 450 (for short-acting insulin) rules. 
• For toddlers and very young children, a 330 or 250 rule might be used instead. 
• The 500 rule for rapid-acting insulin:
ICR = 500* / (Total daily insulin)
*450 for short acting insulin When in use, insulin can be stored at room temperature of 25 or 30 degree Celsius for up to 4 weeks. 
Exposure to high temperatures should be avoided (e.g. leaving in the car compartment).• Less intensive regimen consists of three or less injections a day. 
• Three injections daily consist of 
• Rapid-acting/short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin pre-breakfast.
• Rapid-acting/short-acting alone pre-lunch or pre-dinner
• Intermediate-acting insulin pre-bed.  
• Premixed insulin is not routinely recommended for T1DM because of its fixed ratio of insulin 
components which does not allow flexibility of dosing.

• CGMS uses minimally invasive device to measure SC interstitial fluid glucose every 1 - 5 minutes. It 
is preferred whenever available and affordable. Early use of CGMS in T1DM is associated with better 
diabetes control without frequent finger glucose pricks. 
• Urine or blood ketones measurement should be monitored during episodes of uncontrolled 
hyperglycaemia, intercurrent illness (sick days) and impending ketoacidosis.
• HbA1c measurement is recommended every 3 months
• The recommended HbA1c target for young people with diabetes is less than 7%.
• A balance and healthy diet for age is required with dietician involvement. 
• Encourage fairly regular and consistent meals to match the insulin. 
• Continuous eating pattern (grazing) should be limited.
• Carbohydrate counting should be taught to patients. Insulin dosage should match the carbohydrate 
intake. • Target HbA1c should be less than 7%.
• SMBG targets should be 4 – 10 mmol/L with a tighter fasting range of  4-8 mmol/L.
• CGMS recovered over a 14-day period should have time spent as follows >70% between 3.9-10 mmol/L, 
<4%  <3.9 mmol/L, <1%  < 3 mmol/L, <25%  > 10 mmol/L,  <5%  > 13.9 mmol/L
In places with limited resources and poor glucose monitoring, less stringent targets may have to be 
accepted.
• Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be practiced by all T1DM children  at least 6x per day 
and more frequent during sick days or during exercise.
• Diary to record glucose levels, insulin dosages and dietary details for treatment adjustments. 
• To optimise basal insulin, blood testing should be done at bedtime, during the night (e.g. 3am to detect 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia) and after the overnight fast (pre-breakfast). 
• For adjustment of meal insulin dose, pre-meal blood testing should be done. For subsequent 
adjustment of meal insulin dose, blood testing should be done pre-meal and two hours post-meal to 
show levels of BG in response to the meal insulin. 
• For glycaemic control during vigorous/prolonged exercise, blood testing should be done before, during

The biochemical criteria for the diagnosis of DKA are: 
• Hyperglycemia (blood glucose >11 mmol/L [≈200 mg/dl]) 
• Venous pH <7.3 or serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L
• Ketonemia (blood ß-hydroxybuyrate (BOHB) usually ≥3 mmol/L) or moderate-large ketonuria. 
DKA is categorised by the severity of acidosis which guides rehydration therapy:
• Mild (venous pH <7.3, bicarbonate <18 mmol/L)
• Moderate (venous pH <7.2, bicarbonate <10 mmol/L) 
• Severe (venous pH <7.1, bicarbonate <5 mmol/L) 
• Correct dehydration.
• Correct acidosis and reverse ketosis. 
• Restore blood glucose to near normal. 
• Avoid complications of therapy.
• Identify and treat any precipitating event. 
• Acute management following APLS or PALS guidelines.
• Vital signs and measure weight, current weight should be used for calculations
• Insert intravenous line
• Bedside blood for glucose and ketones
• Venous blood gas, glucose, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, FBC, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium
• Assess for shock, degree of dehydration and GCS
• Start intravenous therapy following guidelines 
• Urine for ketones if blood ketone not available
• Antibiotics and appropriate cultures (blood, urine, throat) if suspect infection or if critically ill child. 
• If laboratory measurement of serum potassium is delayed, perform an ECG for baseline evaluation of

• Fluid replacement should begin 1 hour before starting insulin therapy. 
• The ISPAD guideline 2022 recommends for children who are volume depleted but not in shock, volume 
expansion (resuscitation) should begin immediately with 0.9% saline, 10 to 20 ml/kg infused over 20–30 
min to restore the peripheral circulation. 
• In the presence of shock, 10-20 ml/kg boluses 0.9% saline should be infused as quickly as possible 
• Reassessment after each 10ml/kg bolus is important and repeated if necessary. Total bolus required is 
usually not > 30ml/kg in DKA without other causes of shock or additional loss of fluids.
• Subsequent rehydration and maintenance fluid should be calculated and infused over 24-48 hours.
• Clinical estimates of the volume deficit are subjective and inaccurate in DKA.
• Therefore based on the degree of acidosis, in mild DKA use 5%, moderate DKA 7% and severe 10% 
dehydration.
• The rate of fluid administration usually do not exceed 1.5-2x the daily maintenance requirement. 
• Resuscitation boluses in another centre before assesment should be factored in the rehydration. 
Consider to minus the initial bolus amount from the rehydration fluids especially if excessive fluids were

replacement therapy. The lower dose 0.05 unit/kg/hr can be used for pH >7.15 especially in children < 5 
years old.
• Do not administer IV bolus of insulin at the start of therapy. It may increase the risk of cerebral oedema 
and exacerbate hypokalaemia. 
• The dose of insulin should remain at 0.05 - 0.1 unit/kg/h until DKA resolves. For patients with marked 
sensitivity to insulin (e.g. young children with DKA), the dose may be decreased provided that metabolic 
acidosis continues to resolve. 
• If no improvement is seen in pH, anion gap or blood ketones, reassess the patient, review insulin dose 
and consider other possible causes of impaired response to insulin such as sepsis or errors in insulin 
preparation, route of administration or insufficient fluids. 
• In situations where continuous insulin IV infusion is not possible and in children with uncomplicated 
mild to moderate DKA with normal circulation, hourly or 2 hourly SC rapid-acting insulin (lispro or 
aspart) may be as effective as IV. Dose SC 0.15 unit/kg every 2h (initiated 1 h after fluids), reduced to 0.1 
unit/kg every 2 hr if BG decrease by >5mmol/L even after adding dextrose. 
• SC short-acting (eg actrapid) insulin is another alternative in mild DKA when IV infusion or rapid-acting 
insulin is not available. Suggested starting dose 0.13-0.17unit/kg/dose every 4h. Doses are adjusted by 
10-20%. Frequency may be increased every 2 or 3 hr.
• SC long-acting insulin is required to prevent rebound hyperglycaemia/ketosis.• During initial volume expansion, BG falls steeply. Thereafter, it usually decreases at a rate of 2 - 5 
mmol/L/hour after commencing insulin therapy.
• When BG falls to < 17 mmol/L or falls rapidly >5mmol/L/hour , 5% dextrose should be added to the IV 
fluid and then adjusted accordingly. 10% or 12.5% dextrose may be needed to prevent hypoglycaemia.Insulin therapy 
Use of SC insulinAdjustment of glucose administration:• The decision to switch solution depends on the patient’s hydration status, serum sodium and osmolality. 
• Calculate the corrected sodium (formula as above) and monitor changes. 
• Clinical assessment of hydration status and calculated effective osmolality are valuable guides to fluid 
and electrolyte therapy.
• The aim is to gradually reduce serum effective osmolality to normal. 
• Serum sodium level should increase simultaneously as the serum glucose level decreases  
• Most DKA resolves before 24 h and remaining fluid deficits can be replaced by oral intake after 
transition to subcutaneous insulin. 
• The ISPAD 2022 guideline suggests that calculation of fluid infusion rates for obese children do not need 
to follow ideal weight. However, fluid calculations should not exceed those used in adult protocols, eg 
1L maximum per bolus and 500ml/hour infusion.

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGY• Children with DKA may have total body potassium deficits between 3 and 6 mmol/kg.
• Potassium replacement (refer to table) in DKA on insulin is vital and levels should be monitored closely.
• Serum potassium may decrease rapidly during treatment predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias.
• IV potassium replacement must not exceed 0.5 mmol/kg/hour. 
• ECG changes may help to determine whether the child has hypo- or hyperkalaemia. 
• Hypokalaemia: prolonged PR interval, T-wave flattening and inversion, ST depression, prominent U 
waves and apparent long QT interval.
• Hyperkalaemia: tall, peaked and symmetrical T waves, and shortening of the QT interval.
• If hypokalaemia persists despite a maximum rate of potassium replacement, the rate of insulin 
infusion may be reduced.
• Potassium phosphate may be used together with potassium chloride (KCL) or acetate to avoid 
hypophosphataemia or hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. E.g. 20mmol/L KCL and 20 mmol/L 
potassium phosphate.
• Continuation of intravenous therapy without food consumption >24h is a risk factor for clinically 
significant hypophosphataemia.
• Manifestations of severe hypophosphataemia include encephalopathy, seizures, impaired cardiac 
contraction, arrhythmias, respiratory failure, hemolytic anemia, myopathy, dysphagia, ileus and 
rhabdomyolysis.
• Severe hypophosphataemia <0.32 mmol/L with or without symptoms should be treated promptly. 
Insulin infusion may need to be reduced.
• ISPAD 2022 guideline recommends routine phosphate replacement to prevent hypophosphataemia is 
advisable while available especially in severe DKA.
• Potassium phosphate can be combined with potassium chloride or potassium acetate to provide 
phosphate replacement
• Monitor serum calcium and magnesium carefully during phosphate infusion.
• Fluid and insulin replacement will gradually reverse acidosis. 
• Bicarbonate therapy may cause paradoxical CNS acidosis, hypokalaemia and increasing osmolality. 
Administration of bicarbonate is not recommended except in life threatening hyperkalemia or severe 
acidosis venous pH <6.9 that have compromised cardiac contractility. 
• Important causes of persistent acidosis include insufficient fluid administration, infection/ sepsis and 
incorrect preparation of the intravenous insulin infusion. 
• Lack of resolution of acidosis due to development of hyperchloremic acidosis is generally a benign 
condition and should not delay transition to subcutaneous insulin. Potassium replacement

Normokalemia Start Potassium replacement at 40 mmol/L during rehydration concurrent with insulin.
Hyperkalemia Start potassium replacement only after urine output is documented and when 
potassium is < 5.5 mmol/L.

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGY• Oral fluids should be introduced only with substantial clinical improvement (mild acidosis/ketosis may 
still be present). Persistent ketonuria may occur for several hours after serum BOHB bedside blood 
ketones have normalized. Hence, absence of ketonuria is not used to determine resolution of DKA.
• When oral fluid is tolerated, IV fluid should be reduced accordingly. 
• When the change to SC insulin is planned, a dose of basal (long-acting) insulin should be administered 
in addition to rapid or short-acting insulin. Basal insulin may be given while the child is still receiving 
intravenous insulin infusion to facilitate transition to SC.
• The most convenient time to change to SC insulin is just before a mealtime. As intravenous insulin has 
a short half life, the first SC injection should be given 15-30 min (rapid-acting insulin) or 1 hour (regular 
insulin) before stopping the insulin infusion to allow sufficient time for the insulin to be absorbed.
• Glucose is still monitored frequently at first to prevent hyper and hypoglycaemia
• Initial total insulin dose including long-acting is about 1u/kg/day, lower dose should be used in young 
children. Intensive insulin injections (basal bolus injections) 4 or more times per day are preferable to 
conventional (twice daily) injections.
• In national population studies, mortality rate from DKA in children is 0.15–0.30%. 
• Cerebral oedema accounts for 60–90% of all DKA deaths. 10% - 25% of survivors of cerebral edema 
have significant residual morbidity. 
• Other rare causes of morbidity and mortality include: Sepsis, hypokalaemia and hyperkalaemia, severe 
hypophosphataemia, hypoglycaemia, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, adult respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute pancreatitis. 
• The cause of DKA-related cerebral injury is of ongoing study. Rapid fluid administration resulting in 
changes in serum osmolality was initially thought to be the cause, but recent evidence suggests that 
cerebral hypoperfusion and the hyperinflammatory state in DKA play central roles. Risk factors include 
younger children, severe acidosis & dehydration at presentation, new-onset diabetes and longer 
duration of symptoms.
• Clinically significant cerebral oedema usually develops within the 1st 12 h after treatment has started, 
but may occur before treatment or rarely, as late as 24 - 48 h later. Signs that occur before treatment 
should not be considered in the diagnosis. Introduction of oral fluids and transition to SC insulin injections

Section 10       ENDOCRINOLOGYGender assignment and sex of rearing should be based upon the most probable adult gender identity and 
potential for adult function. 
Factors to be considered in this decision include:-
• Diagnosis.
• Fertility potential.
• Adequacy of the external genitalia for normal sexual function. Adequate phallic size when considering 
male sex of rearing.
• Endocrine function of gonads. Capacity to respond to exogenous androgen.
• Parents’ socio-cultural background, expectations and acceptance.
• Psychosocial development in older children.
• Decision about sex of rearing should only be made by an informed family after careful evaluation, 
documentation, and consultation.
• The goals of surgery are: 
• Genital appearance compatible with gender
• Unobstructed urinary emptying without incontinence or infections
• Good adult sexual and reproductive function
• Removal of dysgenetic gonads to reduce risk of malignancy
• Only surgeons with the expertise in the care of children and specific training in the surgery of DSD 
should perform these procedures.
• Early genitoplasty is feasible only if the precise cause of DSD has been established and gender 
assignment has been based on certain knowledge of post-pubertal sexual outcome. Otherwise, surgery 
should be postponed as genitoplasty involves irreversible procedures such as castration and phallic 
reduction in individuals raised females and resection of uterovaginal tissue in those raised male. 
• The procedure should be anatomically based to preserve erectile function and the innervations of the 
clitoris.
 →If Assigned Female surgical procedure may include
• Removal of testicular tissue
• Vaginoplasty
 →If Assigned Male surgical procedure may include
• Orchidopexy
• Removal of Mullerian structures
• Surgical repair of hypospadias
• Gonadectomy to be considered if dysgenetic gonads
• Psychosocial care should be an integral part of management in order to promote positive adaptation 
and allow parents to express and resolve their concerns
• Psychological assessment at regular intervals is recommended to screen for mental health issues such 
as gender dysphoria and to provide support for families.
• The issue of sex reassignment can present at various stages throughout life. It is important to assess 
the patient’s and parents’ satisfaction with the sex-assignment decision. The implications of a change in 
gender needs careful evaluation and planning.
• Ongoing education of both the parents and child (age-appropriate) at regular intervals is essential, 
because many of these patients will require surgery and hormonal therapy.Gender Assignment

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)  
• CAH is a group of disorders caused by a variety of enzyme deficiencies in the adrenal cortex.
• About 95% of all CAH is caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD)
• The worldwide incidence in most studies ranges from 1:14,000 to 1:18,000 
• 21-OHD is classified into classic and non-classic forms according to the severity of manifestations. 
• The classic form is subclassified into salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms. Patients with simple 
virilising form may show salt loss during severe illness.
• Non-classical CAH (NCCAH) has adequate glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production to escape 
diagnosis at birth but may present with variable degrees of androgen excess later in life
• Both male and female children with NCCAH or simple virilizing CAH can present with premature 
pubarche, tall stature, accelerated linear growth and advanced bone age. 
• Clitoromegaly (girls) and phallic enlargement (boys) may also be present• Clinical presentation of 21-OHD depends on the infant’s gender and severity of disease
• The clinical manifestations of 21-OHD can be as follows : 
1. symptoms caused by adrenal insufficiency or salt-wasting
 ͳSalt loss may manifest from day 5 of life with poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration and poor 
weight gain. If left undiagnosed, patients can present with adrenal crisis which is life-threatening. 
Biochemical parameters may demonstrate hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and 
hypoglycaemia.
 ͳOccasionally there may be delayed presentation to the second to third week of life. 
2. virilization of the external genitalia due to excessive androgens
Females
 - Clitoromegaly or phallus-like structure.
 - Displacement of the vaginal opening towards or into the urethra.
 - Posterior fusion of labia.
 - Scrotalisation of the skin of the labia majora.
 - Variable pigmentation of the external genitalia.

• In a newborn with ambiguous genitalia, CAH due to 21-OHD must be excluded as it is the most common 
cause (virilization of external genitalia without palpable gonads).
• Newborn infants with suspected CAH or those with siblings with CAH should be admitted. 
• These infants should be observed for signs of salt wasting with regular monitoring of:
 ͳweight, hydration status
 ͳvital signs (blood pressure, heart rate), fluid balance 
 ͳblood sugar levels. 
 ͳserial electrolytes and renal function (initial abnormality may not be apparent in the first few days 
of life) 
• Specific laboratory measurements which should be taken (after 48 hours of life) include :
 ͳ17-hydroxyprogesterone, serum cortisol 8 am (early morning), plasma renin, aldosterone and 
testosterone. In addition, DHEAS can be considered. These investigations may need to be sent to 
tertiary laboratory facilities. (e.g. IMR)
• For patients with ambiguous genitalia – additional investigations : 
• Urgent karyotype
• Ultrasound to evaluate internal structure (uterus, gonads)
To confirm the diagnosis, consider standard dose ACTH stimulation test after discussion with paediatric 
endocrinologist. Samples should be obtained at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes after administering 
tetracosactide, measuring  cortisol and 17OHP . • Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia

344 345
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 10        ENDOCRINOLOGYThe principles of treatment for 21-OHD are to :
 ͳsupplement insufficient glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids
 ͳsuppress excessive adrenal androgen production
 ͳensure normal growth and maturation 
• Oral hydrocortisone should be given in 3 divided doses, in the range of 11-15 mg/m2/day to suppress 
excess adrenal androgen production. During infancy, higher doses of hydrocortisone may be needed to 
reduce markedly elevated adrenal hormone levels, but it is important to rapidly reduce the dose when 
target levels are achieved.
• Divided or crushed tablets of hydrocortisone should be used instead of syrup due to uneven distribution 
in liquid form.
• During childhood, the preferred glucocorticoid is hydrocortisone because its short half-life minimizes 
the adverse side effects of longer-acting, more potent ones especially growth suppression. However, in 
some patients who has completed their growth, long-acting glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisolone) can be 
considered.
• Most patients with classical CAH will require mineralocorticoid therapy in the form of oral 
fludrocortisone at doses of 0.05 – 2g/day in divided doses. 
• During the neonatal and early infantile periods, relative mineralocorticoid resistance occurs because of 
immature tubular reabsorption of sodium; administration of sodium chloride in doses of 1 – 2g/day in 
4 – 6 divided doses are required. Sodium chloride replacement is generally not required beyond infancy, 
because sensitivity to mineralocorticoid increases with age.
• Adequate instructions (verbal and written) must be conveyed to the caregivers. Written 
communications (letter) to relevant health care providers regarding the diagnosis/medication/
treatment strategies during acute illness should be kept by the patient/caregivers. 
• All patients on glucocorticoid treatment must have medic alert (card, bracelet or pendant) with them at 
all times to ensure prompt treatment during emergency.
• Appropriate genetic counselling should be given to parents so that proper screening for CAH can be 
done for future children.
At each visit there should be careful physical examination looking for signs of over or undertreatment:
• Height and weight should be assessed at each visit.  Normal growth rate for age is a sign of adequate 
treatment. Overtreatment with glucocorticoids causes a reduction in growth velocity and obesity, 
whereas undertreatment with glucocorticoids causes adrenal insufficiency and accelerated growth 
velocity
• Blood pressure. As excessive mineralocorticoid increases the blood pressure, doctors should reassess 
the fludrocortisone and sodium dose periodically.
• Presence of hyperpigmentation, oily facial skin, acne, pubic or axillary hair which suggest 
undertreatment. 
• Pubertal status
Periodic investigations to monitor control:
• Serum 17OHP , renin, testosterone and electrolytes
• If there are concerns of growth, a bone age should be done. Bone age acceleration indicates possibility 
of ongoing undertreatment.
• Consider screening for testicular adrenal rests by testicular ultrasonogram in children older than the age 
of 10 years.Principles of treatment

Subsequent rehydrating fluids should contain 0.45 – 0.9% NaCl according to serum sodium levels (with 
appropriate dextrose concentration in maintenance fluid). 
• Administer IV hydrocortisone 100 mg/m2  stat followed by 25 mg/m2 six hourly during the acute 
condition.
• If hypoglycaemia is present, correct with 2 ml/kg of dextrose 10%.
• Continuous cardiac monitoring for hyperkalemic changes, and if necessary severe symptomatic 
hyperkalemia needs to be corrected urgently (such as resonium, nebulized salbutamol or even glucose 
and insulin).
• Monitor fluid input and output, vital signs, glucose level, serial serum electrolytes and daily weight.
• Feminizing surgery is needed usually for the severely virilised (Prader staging more or equal to 3) 
females. 
• It should be performed by an experienced surgeon in a centre with multidisciplinary support (paediatric 
endocrinologists, mental health professionals, and social work services).
• The age of surgery is controversial and will depend on the local expertise.
• Patients with CAH and their families should be managed sensitively to minimize the emergence of 
psychological issues
• Due to the effects of hyperandrogenization on the body and brain these patients  are at risk of gender 
dysphoria and may benefit from early referral to professionals with specialised expertise in managing 
such problems. • Parents must be given clear written instruction on higher doses of hydrocortisone during stress/illness 
(during febrile illness (>38.5 C), when vomiting or poor oral intake, after trauma and before surgery).
• During acute illness or stress, oral glucocorticoid dose should be 2-3 times of the usual maintenance 
dose.
• If patients are unable to take oral steroids, parenteral hydrocortisone will be indicated. Intravenous 
hydrocortisone should be administered as in crisis (100 mg/m2  stat followed by 25 mg/m2 six hourly)
If weight status is unsure a bolus dose is given as  below.
First 2 years of age: 0-25mg.

• Pulmonary oedema
• Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
• Subclinical (detected on routine examination)
• The is the commonest form of acute glomerulonephritis in children; especially between 6-10 years of 
age.
• Various pathogenetic mechanisms have been described: streptococcal nephritogenicity and molecular 
mimicry with the kidney ultrastructure and glomerular immune complex formation. Complement

Section 11       NEPHROLOGYChapter 65:
Nephrotic Syndrome  
Nephrotic syndrome is a clinical syndrome of massive proteinuria defined by
•  Nephrotic range proteinuria ≥ 40 mg/m2/hour (≥ 1 g/m2/day) or an early morning urine protein 
creatinine ratio  (UPCR) of ≥ 200 mg/mmol
• Hypoalbuminaemia of < 30 g/l
• Oedema 
• Nephrotic syndrome is caused by alteration to the glomerular filtration barrier that leads to loss of 
proteins in the urine.
• More than 90% of the condition is primary. Primary nephrotic syndrome is an immune disease 
that could be idiopathic, a single gene disease (up to 30%) or circulating factor disease affecting the 
podocytes.
• Secondary nephrotic syndrome could be due to: 
• Infection (Hepatitis B, C, HIV, chronic malaria, subacute bacterial endocarditis, disseminated 
tuberculosis)
• Drugs (NSAIDs)
• Metabolic (Amyloidosis, diabetes mellitus) 
• Systemic disease like systemic lupus erythematosus, neoplasms
• Others (severe obesity, chronic reflux nephropathy with secondary focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis) 
This chapter outlines the management of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Management of secondary forms 
of nephrotic syndrome should follow the management of the primary condition.
• Full blood count (FBC)
• Renal profile: Urea, electrolytes, creatinine 
• Liver function tests, particularly serum albumin 
• Urinalysis: Quantitative urinary protein excretion
• Spot urine protein creatinine ratio (in first morning void) or  
• Timed urine collection e.g., 24 hour urine for protein
• Lipid profile
• Other investigations would depend on the age of the patient, associated kidney impairment, gross 
haematuria, hypertension or features to suggest an underlying secondary cause for the nephrotic 
syndrome.
• These may include the following but not limited to:
• Antinuclear factor / anti-dsDNA 
• Serum complement (C3, C4) levels  
• ASO titres 
• Ultrasound kidney ureter bladder if planned for kidney biopsy or if suspected renal vein thrombosis
• Other tests as indicatedDiagnosis

to 85% of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome have minimal change steroid responsive disease.
• Main indication for renal biopsy is steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome , defined as failure to achieve 
remission despite 4 weeks of adequate corticosteroid therapy.
• Other indications are features that suggest non-minimal change nephrotic syndrome:
• Persistent hypertension

Section 11       NEPHROLOGY• Counsel parents and patients (age-appropriate) about the disease particularly with regards to the high 
probability (85-95%) of relapse.
• Home urine albumin monitoring: once daily dipstick testing of the first morning urine specimen. The 
patient is advised to consult the doctor if proteinuria ≥ 3+ for 3 consecutive days.
• The child is also advised to consult the doctor should he/she become oedematous regardless of the 
urine dipstick result.
• Children on systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents should be advised and 
cautioned about contact with chickenpox and measles. This need to be informed to the doctor urgently 
and if exposed, should be treated like any immunocompromised child who has come into contact with 
these diseases.
• In case of exposure to chickenpox in children with immunosuppressive treatment who have not been 
immunized against VZV, prophylactic treatment with specific Varicella-zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG) or 
oral acyclovir for 5–7 days starting within 7–10 days of the exposure can be given. 
• For patient who are steroid dependent, need to monitor 25-OH-vitamin D level annually, aiming for 
levels > 20 ng/ml (> 50 nmol/l)
• Prednisolone at dose of 60 mg/m2/day (maximum dose 60mg/day) for 6 weeks , followed by alternate 
day (EOD) Prednisolone at 40 mg/m2  EOD (maximum dose 40mg EOD) for 6 weeks  then stop.
• Prednisolone is administered as a single dose, following food and therapy with antacids /proton 
pump inhibitors is not routinely needed. 
• 80% of children achieve remission (defined as urine dipstick trace or nil for 3 consecutive days) 
within 28 days of the corticosteroid treatment.
• Children who fails to achieve complete remission despite 4 weeks of initial treatment with 
Prednisolone therapy of 60mg/m2/day has Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome and should be 
referred to a Paediatric Nephrologist for further management. A kidney biopsy is warranted in these 
children.Corticosteroid is effective in inducing remission of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. 
Once a diagnosis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome has been established, oral Prednisolone should be 
started.  • Confirm that patient has nephrotic syndrome by ensuring that the patient fulfils the case definition.
• Exclude other causes of nephrotic syndrome. If none, then the child probably has idiopathic nephrotic 
syndrome.
• A normal protein diet with adequate calories is recommended.
• No added salt to the diet when child has oedema.
• Penicillin V dosage recommendation during oedema for children who have not complete pneumococcal 
vaccination
• 1-5 years old:   125mg BD 
• 6-12 years old: 250mg BD 
• >12 years old:  500mg BD

trace dipstick on 3 or more consecutive days)  followed by Prednisolone of 40 mg/m2 EOD  for 
(maximum dose 40mg EOD) for 4 weeks  then stop.
• Tapering schedule during alternate day dosing is no longer recommended.
• In children with FRNS  and SDNS, maintenance treatment is indicated once remission is achieved. 
• FRNS should be maintained with either a steroid-sparing agent or low-dose prednisolone 
(preferably ≤ 0.5 mg/kg EOD, maximum at 20mg after EOD.
• SDNS children should be maintained with a steroid-sparing agent.
• Regular evaluation for significant steroid-related adverse effects is necessary while patient is maintained 
on prolonged low dose of prednisolone.
• Common steroid toxicity are hypertension, impaired linear growth, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, 
ophthalmology complications, abdominal striae and behaviour changes.
• Most common relapse trigger is inter-current upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).  
• In children taking alternate day low dose prednisolone, this can be increased to low dose daily 
prednisolone (≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum at 20mg OD) at the onset of infection to prevent a 
relapse (for a maximum of 1 week) 
• Children not on prednisolone should also be considered for a short course of low dose daily 
prednisolone at the onset of  URTI especially if they have a history of repeated infection-related 
relapses.  
Utility of sparing agent in rank order as tabulated below. • The majority of children with nephrotic syndrome will relapse.
• These children do not need admission unless they are grossly oedematous or experience complications 
of nephrotic syndrome.

day) for 8 weeks. (Maximum cumulative dose should not exceed 168 mg/kg). 
• Begin therapy in combination with the alternate-day Prednisolone starting with a dose of 40 mg/
m2EOD and reducing to 10 mg/m2 EOD  until completion of the course of Cyclophosphamide therapy.  
• Three quarter of children with FRNS remains in remission after 2 years. 
• Parents should be counselled about the effectiveness and major side effects; which include leukopenia, 
infection, alopecia, haemorrhagic cystitis, hepatic dysfunction and gonadal toxicity. Risk of azoospermia 
is higher in post pubertal boys. Risk of female infertility is generally lower. 
• In patient who unable to tolerate or uncertain adherence to oral Cyclophosphamide, to discuss with 
paediatric nephrologist regarding IV Cyclophosphamide.
• Monitor full blood count and urinalysis 2 weekly. 
• While on treatment, patient should be kept well hydrated.
• Treatment should be discontinued during significant infection, leukocyte count is  ≤ 4.0 x109/L, 
neutropenia <1.5 x109/L or thrombocytopenia < 50 x109/L and therapy resumed at lower dose after 
recovery. 
• Relapse after a course of Cyclophosphamide is treated as for infrequent relapse. 
• Should the relapse occur soon after a course of Cyclophosphamide when the child is still steroid toxic, 
or if the child again becomes SDNS/FRNS  then a Paediatric Nephrology opinion should be sought for 
other steroid-sparing agent.
• Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
• Calcineurin inhibitors: Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus
• Rituximab • Dose: 2- 2.5 mg/kg EOD (maximum 150mg/day)
• Comparative studies indicate that the risk of relapse in patients receiving Levamisole is similar to 
Cyclophosphamide or MMF.
• Side effects include rashes, leukopenia and raised transaminases. Rarely, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody (ANCA) positivity with related arthritis, rash and other symptoms of vasculitis may occur in 2% 
of children. These side-effects resolve with discontinuation of levamisole.
• Monitor full blood count and liver function test every 3-4 monthly and test ANCA antibodies yearly 
while on therapy.
• Therapy should be discontinued without tapering once patient is in sustained remission and steroid-free

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 11       NEPHROLOGY• Hypovolaemia may occur at disease onset or relapse, especially when associated with diarrhoea, 
vomiting or unsupervised diuretics therapy.
• Clinical features: Abdominal pain, cold peripheries, poor pulse volume, hypotension and haemoconcentration.
• Patient in shock and/or hypotensive should receive boluses 5%  albumin 
• (20 ml/kg over 20-30 minutes) without diuretic as per resuscitation guideline. 
• Children with oedema, once the blood pressure is stabilised, human albumin 20 or 25% may be given at 
0.5-1.0 g/kg over 4-6 hours, with frusemide (1-2 mg/kg IV) given in the middle/at the end, if volume has 
been restored and urine output insufficient.
• During a relapse, patient that has mild oedema generally do not need diuretics. Oedema subsides once 
patient is rendered into remission following initiation of prednisolone.
• Patient with severe oedema (gross ascites, scrotal/vulval oedema or overt anasarca) may require 
inpatient oedema control.
• First line: Frusemide
• There is consideration to switch from oral to IV to overcome poor gut absorption due to the 
oedematous state. 
• Dose: IV Frusemide 1-2 mg/kg each time and this may be repeated if necessary provided the 
patient is hemodynamically stable. 
• Need to monitor for hypokalaemia while on frusemide.  
• Second line: If the patient does not respond well to frusemide, human albumin can be given together 
with it. 
• Human albumin (20 or 25%) at 0.5 - 1.0 g/kg given together with  IV frusemide at 1-2 mg/kg. There 
are variations in practice: albumin may be given over 2 hours infusion followed immediately with 
frusemide or over 4 hours infusion with the frusemide dose given in between as well as at the end 
of the infusion. 
• Caution: fluid overload and pulmonary oedema can occur with albumin infusion especially in those with 
impaired renal function. Urine output and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
• Clinical features of fluid overload : Basal lung crepitations, rhonchi, hepatomegaly, hypertension
• During relapse, serum albumin does not need to be monitored. Albumin infusion should be used 
judiciously and not to aim at increasing the number. As the patient achieves remission, serum albumin 
will normalise.
• Refractory cases may require continuous infusion of frusemide or addition of other types of diuretics 
such as bumetanide, thiazide, spironolactone or amiloride (sequential blockade). Nephrology consult is 
necessary in such cases.• Clinical features: Fever, abdominal pain and tenderness in children with   newly diagnosed or relapse 
nephrotic syndrome
• Investigations: Blood culture, FBC
• Treatment: Parenteral penicillin and a third generation cephalosporin
• Preventive anticoagulation/antiplatelet is not recommended in the acute nephrotic stage. 
• If thrombotic complications occur, thorough investigation and adequate treatment with anticoagulation 
is usually needed. Please consult a Paediatric Nephrologist.Complications of nephrotic syndrome and management

situations of stress e.g. acute illness /infection.
• It is important not to omit the steroid completely in children on prolonged therapy during acute illness 
or when they undergo surgery / trauma to prevent crisis. Sick day management should include doubling 
the existing steroid dose and this may be given intravenously at equivalent Hydrocortisone dose. 
• In children with established acute adrenal insufficiency, regular stress doses of intravenous 
Hydrocortisone (2-4 mg/kg every 6 hourly; maximum 100mg QID) should be started urgently. This is 
adjusted according to response and reduced over 4-5 days to oral maintenance dose. Hydration status 
should be maintained and standard treatment of the acute illness (antimicrobial therapy inclusive) 
instituted. Consult endocrinologist.

• Genetic testing is required in congenital/infantile nephrotic syndrome (onset < 3 months and within first 
year of life respectively), nephrotic syndrome with extra renal features, familial steroid resistance, non-
response to therapy with calcineurin inhibitor and prior to kidney transplantation. 
• Immunosuppressants used for SRNS are Cyclosporin, Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate mofetil,  
Cyclophosphamide infusion, IV Methylprednisolone (Mendoza) and biologic agents such as Rituximab 
infusion. With time, more novel therapeutic strategies may be available.
• Give live vaccines 4 weeks after cessation of corticosteroid therapy, 3 months after cessation of 
Cyclosporin/MMF/Cyclophosphamide and 6 months post Rituximab.
• Other types of vaccines (non-live) may be administered when the child is in remission. 
• Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all children with nephrotic syndrome.  
• Patient receiving immunosuppressants should be prioritised to receive the COVID vaccine and the 
additional/booster dose.
Core Messages: 
• Most children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome demonstrates steroid responsiveness
• Children on steroid should be monitored for steroid toxicity
• Steroid unresponsiveness predicts future decline in kidney function • Control of oedema; patient may need regular diuretics (Frusemide/Bumetanide ± Thiazide/ Amiloride/
Spironolactone). 
• Restriction of dietary sodium.
• Antiproteinuria ± blood pressure control with ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). 
Blood pressure and creatinine monitoring is necessary 1-2 weeks after initiation of ACE inhibitor / ARB. 
• Penicillin prophylaxis in oedematous state.
• Monitoring: 
 ͳKidney function, liver function, calcium, phosphate, urine protein and therapeutic drug monitoring 
if applicable at 3 monthly interval.
 ͳLipid profile, thyroid function test (TFT) and 25-OH-Vitamin D assay annually or as clinically 
indicated.
 ͳL-thyroxine treatment and lipid lowering agent (statin) to be consider based on TFT and lipid profile 
result.
• Dysgammaglobulinaemia is common in nephrotic state but this does not warrant routine monitoring 
unless in the event of recurrent infections.
• Nutrition: normal caloric and dietary protein intake, as appropriate for age with salt restriction. 
• Response to immunosuppression remains the most important predictor of long term kidney outcome.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)  
• Abrupt (within hours) decrease in renal function, with both injury (structural damage) and impairment 
(loss of function) as measured by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate.
• Potentially reversible 
• Evolving definition (AKIN, pRIFLE, KDIGO) . However, most widely accepted definition is KDIGO whereby 
measurement of serum creatinine and urine output are necessary to stage the degree of AKI.
• Urea is an unreliable marker for AKI as it is secreted and reabsorbed at tubular level, hence not 
accurately reflecting renal function. 
• Similarly, serum creatinine is also unreliable as it is secreted at tubular level. However, this remains the 
best marker for kidney function since it is universally available in most hospitals and inexpensive despite 
its limitation.
• Novel biomarkers in research include neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C and 
kidney injury molecule (KIM-1).
• Oliguria (< 300 ml/m2 /day; < 1 ml/kg/hour in neonates, < 0.5 ml/kg/hour in children)

Core Messages: 
• AKI is potentially reversible and aggressive management is warranted to mitigate this 
• Children with severe AKI requires long term surveillance as they are at risk of chronic kidney 
insufficiency 
• Neonates are special group at risk for AKI and it is important to identify this early as neonatal AKI 
may lead to nephron loss and risk of CKD later.

Section 11       NEPHROLOGY1 Advance the large bore cannula (18-20G) perpendicularly until the peritoneum is breached (a ‘give” 
is felt). Connect to the dialysate bag and instil 10-20 ml/kg dialysate to help prevent traumatic 
puncture of the underlying viscus by creating a false ascites.
2 Check catheter for any breakages (by withdrawing the stylet) before insertion.
3 Make a small skin incision (slightly smaller than the diameter of the catheter) using a size 11 
straight surgical blade) and avoid cutting the muscle layer. 
4 Introduce the catheter with the stylet perpendicular to the abdominal wall while controlling the 
length with the dominant hand, until the peritoneum is pierced.
5 The stylet is then withdrawn, and the catheter gently pushed in, directing it caudally towards the 
pelvic cavity until all the perforations are well within the peritoneal cavity
1 Various commercial kits and sizes are available. In resource limited situation, improvisation should 
be considered.
2 Advance the large bore cannula (18G or larger) perpendicularly until the peritoneum is breach 
(a ‘give” is felt). Connect to the dialysate bag and instil 10-20 ml/kg dialysate to help prevent 
traumatic puncture of the underlying viscus by creating a false ascites 
3 Thread and advance the guide wire through the cannula aiming towards the pelvic cavity.
4 Remove the cannula. Make a skin nick. Ensure the exit site is kept as small as possible to minimise 
risk of leak. Over the guide wire, introduce the dilator.
5 Subsequent steps can be either:   
a. Soft PD catheter :
• Introducer in the soft PD catheter set comes with an overlying peel-away sheath. Once the 
introducer is inserted remove the dilator and guide wire while retaining the sheath in the 
abdomen.    
• Introduce the soft PD catheter through the sheath into the abdominal cavity directing it to 
the pelvic cavity until the external cuff fits snugly at the skin. 
• Peel off the sheath leaving the catheter in situ. Two operators needed to perform this step. 
Secure the catheter with the cuff slightly buried with a purse string suture. 
b. Multi-purpose drainage e.g., “pigtail” catheter and the double lumen central venous catheter :
• For the multi-purpose drainage e.g., “pigtail” catheter and the double lumen central 
venous catheter, introduce the dilator over the guide wire to dilate the track and remove 
leaving the guide wire in place.
• Insert the catheter over the guide wire and direct it to the pelvic cavity. Then, the guide 
wire is removed leaving the catheter in situ. Secure the catheter with a purse string suture.
6 Cover the site with dry gauze and secure with plaster. If there is staining or 
 bleeding seen, this needs to be dealt with immediately.
7 Connect the catheter to the PD line; this may be improvised using     
consumables available in the unit if commercial ready-to-use device (Y set) is not available. The 
entire system i.e., the dialysate, catheter and drainage bag should be connected in a closed circuit 
and three-way taps applied to ease operation.  For small fill volumes (≤ 100ml), a buretrol or 
chamber can be used to measure this volume accurately. Acute stiff PD catheter (applicable to improvised catheter such as chest tube)

• Start at 10-20 ml/kg and observe for discomfort, cardiorespiratory deterioration or leakage from 
catheter exit site. 
• The volume can be increase gradually to a maximum of 30-40 ml/kg or 800-1000 ml/m2, if tolerated.
• FV should not exceed 800 ml/m2 in < 2 years 
PD Solution
• Type of PD solution 
• Standard commercially available lactate-based: 1.5%, 2.5%, 4.25% dextrose.
• Bicarbonate dialysate, useful if lactic acidosis is a significant problem e.g. in sepsis associated 
with lactic acidosis, hepatic failure or inborn errors of metabolism. 
• PD is usually initiated with dextrose 1.5% concentration; higher concentration is required if more 
rapid ultrafiltration is desired.  
• Watch out for hyperglycemia, hypotension, or hypovolaemia with the use of more hypertonic PD 
solution.
Duration of PD
• The duration of PD depends on the needs of the patient – usually continuous throughout a full 24 
hour period.
• Close monitoring for peritonitis, electrolytes, drug dosages and therapeutic drug monitoring, should 
be conducted when providing acute PD.
Note:
• In centres with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the bicarbonate solution used for CRRT 
can be used.
• In centres where this is not readily available, the assistance of the pharmacist is required to constitute 
a physiological dialysis solution. For example, dialysis fluid can be made by adding 50% Dextrose to 
either Ringer’s Lactate, Plasmalyte B or Hartmann’s solution The acute PD prescription • Heparin (500 unit/L) can be added into the PD fluid to prevent fibrin clots.
• Antibiotics can be added to PD fluid to treat PD peritonitis.
• Once serum potassium falls below 4 mmol/l, potassium chloride (KCL) (4 mmol/L) should be added.
(1 gm of KCL in 10 ml ampule is equivalent to 13.3 mmol of potassium.   Hence adding 3 ml to 1 litre 
would result in dialysate with 4.0 mmol/L of potassium).
• If bicarbonate solution is used as PD fluid, Dextrose (1-4%) would need to be added to aid ultrafiltration.  
• Input / output chart, vital signs and PD chart should be kept up to date – close monitoring is mandatory 
to achieve and maintain normotension and euvolaemia. 
• Check for exit site leaks and effluent turbidity – if present, this must be noted to the doctor 
immediately. Send PD fluid for cell count and culture and sensitivity if effluent is turbid and antibiotics 
should be initiated - decision to continue PD would then need to be evaluated.
• Blood urea, serum electrolytes, and creatinine should be requested according to clinical context; these 
should be reviewed by the doctor once ready. These should be measured 12-hourly for the first 24 
hours and once daily, as indicated. Further additives to PD fluid:

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 11       NEPHROLOGY• Vascular access is the key component of these modalities, and a wide variety of temporary vascular 
catheters are available in the market.
• Prescription for acute HD should be discussed with the paediatric nephrologist. 
• Biohazard serology (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV) must be screened for prior to initiation of either 
therapy. 
• Complications include blood vessel thrombosis, haemorrhage, catheter related blood stream infection 
and introduction of air emboli.
• Acute HD is efficient for rapid solute clearance and ultrafiltration especially in life threatening 
hyperkalaemia, drug toxicity and tumour lysis syndrome.
• CRRT has the ability to control UF separately from solute removal, hence allowing greater flexibility 
within the prescription i.e.:
 Êbetter uraemia control in metabolic crisis and poisoning 
 Êthere is usually no need for fluid restriction, allowing for adequate nutrition  
 Êallows for large volume infusions (medication/blood products) 
• The main disadvantages are: 
 Êrequires trained personnel for safe and proper provision of CRRT/HD
 Êcost (filters/dialysate)
 Ê anticoagulation is required to prevent filters from clotting 
• For children who continue to require longer term kidney replacement therapy or progress to end stage 
kidney failure, occlusion of dialysis access (Tenckhoff/tunneled catheter) is a common mechanical 
complication.
• Fibrinolytic agents (urokinase/streptokinase) have a role in catheter salvage – the use of these would 
warrant consultation with a paediatric nephrologist.Acute haemodialysis and CRRT:
Longer term kidney replacement therapy and dialysis access occlusion 
Core Messages: 
• Although various modalities of kidney replacement therapies have been described, they may not be 
readily available in reality.
• Nevertheless, PD is feasible even in resource limited setting and improvisation of techniques is 
possible to allow delivery of care. 
• An attempt of dialysis should be offered to any child with AKI unless contraindicated.

• It may require early repair.
Tethered cord syndrome
• Characterized by onset of lower limb weakness and bladder dysfunction during pubertal growth 
spurt.
• Tissue attachments caused by spina bifida occulta or prior myelomeningocele repair prevent the 
spinal cord from moving as the vertebra elongates, resulting in mechanical stretching and ischaemic

Neurogenic Bladder
• Neurogenic bladder is bladder dysfunction caused by pathology of the brain or spinal cord.
• The risk of serious complications is high and can be prevented with proactive management.
• Management of patients with spinal dysraphism is long-term. It   often requires a multidisciplinary team 
that will look into all aspects of care including 
 ÊCognitive impairment, neurological deficits, and seizures
 ÊBladder and bowel management
 ÊChronic kidney disease (CKD)
 ÊFoot and leg deformity

Proactive Management for neonate with myelomeningocele
• Early clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)
• CIC every 4-6 hours as it leads to better acceptability from parents and child who get used to the 
routine. Parents may decrease frequency of CIC if post-void residual urine is minimal. It is often 
difficult to initiate CIC in older children and there is evidence that proactive management preserves 
kidney function, reduces renal scarring rate and results in fewer bladder augmentation procedures.
• Antibiotic treatment of symptomatic UTI
• Anticholinergic if upper tract dilatation or high pressure bladder • The goal of initial evaluation is to determine the underlying cause of neurogenic bladder and other 
disability, and risk stratification of the patient.
The aims of management are:
• Low pressure storage of urine in order to protect the upper urinary tract
• Complete bladder emptying in order to prevent recurrent UTI and bladder stones
• Continence, allowing integration in school and community• Neonate has not passed urine within 24 hours of life or has poor and dribbling urine stream
• Palpable bladder
• Examination of the external genitalia
• Examination of the back for sacral pit, tuft of hair, flattened buttocks, absence of upper gluteal cleft, 
under-developed lower limbs, and other stigmata
• Parent circumstances and receptiveness 
• Renal profile
• Ultrasound (US) of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder
• Ultrasound spine may be performed within the first 6 months of life, as the incompletely ossified 
posterior vertebral arch provides an acoustic window. MRI spine is preferred in children older than 6 
months if indicated.
• Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) is rarely indicated unless other conditions such as PUV need to 
be rule out

• In children with no upper tract dilatation on ultrasound, expectant management include regular 
monitoring. 
• CIC and anticholinergic medication are only commenced when there is upper tract dilation on 
ultrasound, or UTI.
Other voiding methods  using manual suprapubic pressure on bladder (Crede method) or Valsalva are 
not recommended as bladder emptying is incomplete, and these methods worsen upper tract reflux and 
dilatation.Expectant Management for neonate with spinal bifida occulta 
How to initiate CIC
1. CIC should be commenced once the diagnosis is confirmed or after child has undergone surgical 
repair of myelomeningocele.
2. Trained health care professional explains indication and technique of CIC.
Procedure
1. Assemble all equipment: Appropriate sized catheter (hydrophilic, gel reservoir and non-coated 
catheter), lubricant, small mirror (for girls), and kidney dish.
2. Wash hands with soap and water.
3. Clean the urethral orifice with clean water.
For boys:
1. Use one hand to lift the penis and stretch the urethral. 
2. Lubricate the catheter, with lignocaine gel or K-Y jelly.
3. Use the other hand to insert the catheter into the urethra.
4. Advance catheter with gentle firm pressure until catheter tip reaches bladder and urine begins to 
drain through the catheter.  There may be some resistance as the catheter tip reaches the bladder 
neck. 
5. If there is resistance to insertion – slightly withdraw the catheter, stretch penis further, and apply 
gentle perineal pressure before inserting the catheter again.
For girls:
1. Use one hand to separate labia.
2. Lubricate the catheter, with lignocaine gel or K-Y jelly.
3. Use the other hand to insert the catheter into the urethra.
4. Advance catheter with gentle firm pressure until catheter tip reaches bladder and urine begins to 
drain through the catheter.
For both boys and girls
1. Urine may be drained into a kidney dish or directly into the toilet bowl. 
2. Once urine stops flowing, the catheter should be rotated and for further urine drainage and then 
withdrawn slowly.
3. Wash hands after upon completion.

limited availability of this procedure, children should be referred earlier for urodynamic studies when 
they have the following findings:
• Recurrent UTI
• Upper urinary tract dilatation on ultrasound 
• Incontinence despite CIC
• Thickened bladder wall
• Raised serum creatinineFollow up care
Urodynamic Studies
Timing of urodynamic studyHow often should CIC be performed?
1. Start with CIC 5-6 times per day – morning upon walking up, mid-morning, during school recess, 
before lunch, before teatime, after dinner and just before bedtime. 
2. Parent may decrease frequency of CIC if post-void residual is minimal.
Can catheters be reused?
1. Clean re-used supplies do not increase the likelihood of UTI.
2. After using a catheter, rinse it well under running tap water, air dry and store in a clean and dry 
container. 
Alternative to CIC: Vesicostomy 
1. In children who develop recurrent UTI if parents are unable to perform CIC
2. In patients with elevated bladder pressure despite compliance to CIC
3. In patients with multiple other disabilities which increase caregiver burden

Section 11       NEPHROLOGY• The incidence of bacteriuria may be as high as 76% among patients who perform regular intermittent 
catheterization. 
• Untreated bacteriuria seldom leads to symptomatic infection or upper tract deterioration 
• Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI, this needs to balance against 
the risk of antibiotic resistance. 
• Antibiotics prophylaxis can be stopped for most of the infants once parents are comfortable with CIC. 
• Explore other causes of recurrent UTI such as tight foreskin, constipation, poor compliance to CIC and 
elevated bladder pressure 
• May be used in patients unable to tolerate the side effects of anticholinergic medication and as a 
temporizing measure before bladder augmentation.
• It improves bladder compliance, increase bladder compliance, increase bladder capacity, inhibit 
detrusor overactivity, prevent detrimental remodelling and fibrosis of bladder.
• Its effect last 8-15 months and would need repeat injections
• Surgical reconstruction should be considered in symptomatic children with unfavorable urodynamic 
parameters such as poor bladder compliance and detrusor leak point pressure > 40 cm H2O.
• Bowel segments (ileum/sigmoid colon) or Native ureter may be used to increase bladder capacity. 
• Creation of catheterisable channels (Mitrafanoff) using the appendix, ileum or sigmoid colon may 
facilitate CIC.• Overnight bladder drainage reduces frequency of UTI, improves upper tract dilatation and is an 
alternative to bladder augmentation in children with poorly compliant bladder in early stage of CKD.• Anticholinergics agents inhibits binding of acetylcoline to its muscarinic receptors resulting in relaxing 
effect on urinary bladder. 
When to start anticholinergic?
• Upper tract dilatation or high-pressure bladder
Oxybutynin Hydrochloride
• Dosage is 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses
• It is safe in infants < 1 year of age
• Side effects: constipation, feeling warm, cognitive and behaviour changes

without soiling. 
• Patients should be encouraged to evacuate their bowels with any of the following treatment modalities.
Behaviour modification  
• Position: Footstool to ensure knees are higher than hips. Lean forward and put elbows on knee. A toilet 
ring should be placed over the toilet seat if needed.
• Toilet sits: up to 5 minutes, 1-3 times per day.
• Chart or diary: to reinforce positive behaviour and record frequency of bowel movement. 
Dietary modification  
• Increasing dietary fiber, sugar free Nutri fiber
Medications
• Osmotic laxatives: Lactulose, Polyethylene glycol (Macrogol)
• It binds water, soften stool and activate bowel movement
• As sufficient amount of liquid in the colon is needed for the medication to be effective, the patient 
should be encouraged to drink enough water 
• Other laxative: Bisacodyl
• Enema: Glycerin enema
• How to use Glycerin enema?
 ▪Child should lie on his/her side with legs pulled up
 ▪Squeeze liquid into rectum and remove
 ▪Dosage: Pre-school children 5ml, School-aged children 10ml
 ▪Child presses buttocks together for 15-20 minutes before heading to the toilet 
Colonic irrigation
• Retrograde/Antegrade continence enema. 
• Children with neurogenic bladder and intact cognition should be encouraged to receive education in a 
regular school.
• Communicate with school authorities to encourage integration of students with spinal dysraphism with 
other able-bodied students.
• This is because lack of formal education and school leaving certificate prevents entry into vocational or 
tertiary education and limits the patient’s potential to be self-sufficient.
• Folate supplementation during the periconceptional period prevents spina bifida. 
• It is recommended that all women of child bearing age should receive at least 0.4mg of folic acid daily.

Urinary Tract Infection and Vesicoureteric Reflux
• Urinary tract infection (UTI) comprises 5% of febrile illnesses in early childhood; before age 2 years, 
2.1% of girls and 2.2% of boys will have had a UTI.
• UTI is an important risk factor for the development of hypertension, kidney failure and end stage kidney 
disease.
• Symptoms depend on the age of the child and the site of infection. 
• In infants and toddlers: signs and symptoms are non-specific e.g. fever, vomiting, irritability, jaundice 
and failure to thrive. 
• UTI should be considered in children with unexplained fever. 
• Symptoms of lower UTI such as pain with micturition and frequency are often not recognized before the 
age of two.
• General examination, growth, blood pressure. 
• Abdominal examination for distended bladder, ballotable kidneys, fecal masses, genitalia, and anal tone. 
• Examine the back for any spinal lesion. 
• Look for lower limb deformities or wasting (to suggest possibility of  neurogenic bladder).• Urinary tract infection  is growth of bacteria in the urinary tract or combination of clinical features and 
presence of bacteria in the urine.
• Significant bacteriuria  is defined as the presence of > 105 colony forming units (cfu) of a single organism 
per ml of freshly voided urine (Kass). 
• Acute pyelonephritis  is bacteriuria presenting clinically with fever > 38⁰C and/or loin pain and 
tenderness. It carries a higher risk of kidney scarring. 
• Acute cystitis  is infection limited to the lower urinary tract presenting clinically with acute voiding 
symptoms: dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain or incontinence. 
• Asymptomatic bacteriuria  is presence of bacteriuria in the urine in an otherwise asymptomatic child.Introduction

Collection of Urine
Suprapubic aspiration (SPA)  
• Best technique (“gold standard”) of obtaining an uncontaminated urine sample.
• Any gram-negative growth is significant.
• Technique: Refer Practical Procedures
Catheterisation
• Sensitivity 95%, specificity 99%, as compared to SPA.
• Low risk of introducing infection but have higher success rates and the procedure is less painful 
compared to SPA.
Clean catch urine specimen
• Recommended in a child who is bladder trained/continent.
• In younger pre-continent infant, Voiding Stimulation Technique facilitates faster clean catch by 
triggering involuntary voiding reflexes in the newborn (The Quick-Wee® method)  
Bag urine specimen
• High contamination rate of up to 70%.
• Negative culture excludes UTI in untreated children.
• Positive culture should be confirmed with a clean catch or SPA.• Accurate diagnosis is extremely important as false diagnosis of UTI would lead to unnecessary 
interventions that are potentially harmful and costly. 
• The diagnosis is best made with a combination of culture and urinalysis. 
• The quality of the urine sample is of crucial importance. 
Urine specimen transport
• If collected urine cannot be cultured within 4 hours; refrigerate specimen 40C or add a bacteriostatic 
agent e.g. boric acid (1.8%) 
• Use container pre-filled with boric acid and fill urine to required level. 
Urine testing  
• Rapid diagnosis of UTI can be made by examining the fresh urine with urinary dipstick and microscopy. 
However, where possible, a fresh specimen of urine should be sent for culture and sensitivity.
• All infants with febrile UTI should be admitted and intravenous antibiotics started as for acute 
pyelonephritis. 
• In patients with high risk of serious illness, it is preferable that the urine sample should be obtained 
first; however, treatment should be started even if urine sample is unobtainable.
• Routine prophylaxis whilst awaiting investigations is not recommended but may be indicated following 
severe infections or recurrent UTIs while awaiting investigations.
• Recent evidence has shown that antimicrobial prophylaxis does reduce the risk of febrile or 
symptomatic UTI in children with VUR III or IV but has no significant effect on the incidence of renal 
scarring. 
• Hence antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in the following: 
 ÊInfants and children with recurrent symptomatic UTI 
 ÊInfants and children with VUR grade III and above
** Note: When it is not possible to collect urine by non-invasive methods (clean catch/ voiding stimulation 
technique), catheterisation or SPA should be used.  Please refer to section on Procedures. Diagnosis

Section 11       NEPHROLOGY• Children who have had a UTI should be encouraged to have adequate fluid intake.
• Children who have had a UTI should have ready access to clean toilets when required and should not be 
expected to delay voiding.
• Constipation should be avoided.
• In boys with recurrent UTI and high grade reflux, circumcision is beneficial to reduce the risk of UTI.
• BBD describes a spectrum of lower urinary symptoms accompanied by faecal elimination issues that 
manifest primarily by constipation and/or encopresis.
• Increased rectal faecal load can affect bladder emptying and/or storage by: 
1. mechanical compression, resulting in decreased bladder capacity that can cause urge incontinence 
and frequency
2. changing the physiological neural stimuli of the bladder and pelvic floor muscles, leading to 
progressively decreased urge to evacuate, chronic bladder spasms, insufficient emptying, and 
significant post-void urine volumes.
• Treatment of BBD includes high fibre diet, use of laxatives, timed frequent voiding, regular bowel 
movement and adequate position and toilet posturing. 
• Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is defined as the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureter 
and collecting system. 
• In most individuals VUR results from a congenital anomaly of ureterovesical junction (primary 
VUR), whereas in others it results from high pressure voiding secondary to posterior urethral valve, 
neurogenic bladder or voiding dysfunction (secondary VUR).
• Commonest radiological abnormality in children with UTI (30 – 40%). 
• Children with VUR are thought to be at risk for further episodes of pyelonephritis with potential for

• It is suspected when there is a renal pelvis dilation, without ureteric dilatation.
Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (10-40% of patients)
• The degree of renal pelvis dilatation does not correlate with reflux grade, and a normal postnatal 
ultrasound (US) does not rule out presence of reflux.

Diuretic renography in perinatal UTD  
A diuretic renogram should be performed when PUJO or vesicoureteric junction obstruction is 
suspected.
• Tc-99m Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic Acid (DTPA) nuclear 
renograms are dynamic scans that provide information on relative kidney function and drainage of 
the upper urinary tracts.
• MAG3 has higher kidney uptake because it is cleared predominantly by tubular secretion, making 
it suitable for use even in neonates, patients with obstructive uropathy and patients with kidney 
impairment.
• DTPA is cheap and widely available. It is cleared predominantly by glomerular filtration, making it 
suitable for use in older children with normal kidney function.
• To obtain optimal results, it is best performed after 6 weeks of life, allowing for maturation of 
neonatal kidneys. In patients with severe hydronephrosis and cortical thinning, the test may be 
performed earlier.
• The infant should be prepared for the procedure with adequate hydration and bladder 
catheterization. A distended bladder delays upper tract drainage leading to a false positive report.
Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG)  
• MCUG is indicated in infants with suspected VUR or PUV and to look for abnormalities such as 
ureterocele or an ectopic ureter.
• Refer chapter on Urinary Tract Infection, Practical Procedures
• Refer chapter on Urinary Tract Infection   
• Other investigations may be necessary in situations where a diagnosis is still unclear. These tests are 
often invasive and should be done in a specialist setting.
• Cystoscopy  may be performed to look of PUV, ectopic ureter insertion and ureterocele.

Section 11       NEPHROLOGYThe treatment goal should be a reduction of SBP and DBP to < 90th percentile and < 130/80 mmHg in 
adolescents ≥ 13 years old. Treatment Approach
• Exercise
• Weight loss
• Low-salt or no-added-salt diet
• Avoidance of smoking (in teens)
Initiate pharmacologic therapy in children and with one or more of the following conditions:
• HTN with failed lifestyle modifications 
• Symptomatic HTN 
• Stage 2 HTN without a clearly modifiable factor (eg.obesity)
• Any stage of HTN associated with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. 
• Hypertensive end-organ damage, most often left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 
Drug choice should be targeted to the child’s underlying pathophysiology and presence of concurrent 
disorders.
• A child with HTN associated with CKD and proteinuria, diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, an 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) is the most 
appropriate first-line agent
• A child with HTN and migraine a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker is the most appropriate 
agent 
• A child with corticosteroid-induced HTN, a diuretic most appropriate

Hypertensive emergency  is defined as an acute severe symptomatic elevation in BP with evidence of 
potentially life-threatening symptoms or target organ damage. BP is commonly elevated far above the level 
of stage 2 HTN.
Hypertensive urgency  is defined as an acute severe elevation in BP WITHOUT  severe, life-threatening 
symptoms or evidence of acute target organ damage.
Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by severe BP elevation with cerebral edema and neurological 
symptoms of lethargy, coma, and/or seizures. It can be produced with no extreme BP elevations when the 
HTN appears as a sudden onset, since the autoregulation of cerebral flow is not able to control the rapid BP 
increment.Hypertensive Emergencies

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 11       NEPHROLOGY• Admit patient to ICU/HDW for close monitoring/support of the vital organs.
• Establish vascular access.
• Continuous BP monitoring, preferably via intra-arterial catheter.
• Urine output monitoring.
• Manage any serious complications before or as hypertension is being treated.
• In the case of hypertensive encephalopathy, neuroimaging is required.
• Treatment strategy is directed at lowering BP promptly but gradually. (A sudden decrease can lead 
to neurological complications such as intracranial bleeding. Avoid short acting Nifedipine as this may 
precipitate a sudden uncontrolled drop in BP).
• The initial goal of therapy is to reduce the BP not more than 25% of the planned reduction over the 
first 8 hours. Thereafter, the remaining reduction is achieved gradually over the next 24 hours.  
• The target BP in such situation generally should be at the 90th- 95th percentile.  
• Children with a hypertensive emergency should always be treated with intravenous medications. 
Continuous infusion is safer than bolus. 
• Hypertensive urgencies can be treated by oral medications. Management Principles of Hypertensive Emergencies

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Children 
Definition: Children who suffer from CKD are those with abnormalities in renal structure or function that 
persists for more than 3 months. CKD patients have long-term morbidity & mortality as well as linked to a 
much-reduced quality of life.
 
Criteria for CKD is either of the two following presentations for > 3 months (KDIGO 2012).
1. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2
2. Markers of kidney damage evidenced by:
 ͳAlbuminuria or proteinuria
 ͳUrine sediment abnormalities
 ͳElectrolyte and other abnormalities due to tubular disorders 
 ͳHistology abnormalities 
 ͳStructural abnormalities detected by imaging 
 ͳHistory of kidney transplant
Caveat: This staging does not apply to children less than 2 years old due to ongoing renal maturation. A 
healthy newborn would have an eGFR estimated between 20-60 ml/min/1.73m2 that will continue to rise to 
finally achieve adult normal values by the age of 1-2 years old.Risk for CKD progressionDefinition

low sugar, high vegetable and fruit intake
• Optimal blood pressure control helps to retard 50% of annual reduction in eGFR 
• Monitor for urine microalbuminuria / proteinuria 
• ACE inhibitor / ARB are both renoprotective by reducing the proteinuria independent of BP 
lowering.  
• Adversely causes bone resorption and growth retardation.
• Monitor blood gases.
• Aim for a serum bicarbonate level 22-25 mmol/l.
• Treatment: Oral sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mmol/kg/day.
• Altered calcium-phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism can lead to bony deformities 
and abnormal growth.
• Monitor serum Ca2+, PO4-, albumin, ALP , PTH assay
• Keep serum phosphate and calcium within the age-appropriate normal range.

Treatment options:
i. Oral iron supplement
ii. Parenteral iron (Iron (III)-hydroxide sucrose complex, Iron (III) hydroxide dextran, ferric 
derisomaltose, ferric carboxymaltose) in CKD cases with limited intestinal iron absorption or no 
response to oral iron supplement.
• Poor growth is common in children with chronic kidney disease due to poor appetite & protein-
energy wasting.
In cases with fluid restriction, energy-dense formula milk or fortification of milk feeds may be 
considered based on their requirement as below:
i. Infants: Fortification of breast milk or infant formula with protein powder, glucose polymer or 
fat emulsion (Precaution: The renal solute load could be too high).
Alternative is the low solute, high energy formula with low levels of protein, potassium, and 
phosphate but its availability is limited by its high cost.
ii. Older children:  Energy-dense renal formula
Consider gastrostomy feeding for children with poor oral intake, preferably with overnight 
infusion feeding to optimize growth as much as possible.
• Children with chronic kidney disease can be considered for growth hormone treatment if they still 
have persistent growth failure even after optimal nutrition intake.3. Anemia (Renal anemia)

• Red cell indices: Low MCV, Low MCH values
• Low serum Iron, High TIBC
• Low serum ferritin
• Nutritional counselling
• If breastfed, maintain breastfeeding
• Use iron fortified cereals
• Oral iron medication
• Give 6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron
• Continue for 6-8 weeks after haemoglobin level is restored to normal
• Dose calculation depends on the elemental iron in the preparation
• Syrup FAC (Ferrous ammonium citrate): the content of elemental iron per ml depends on the 
preparation available, (usually 86 mg/5ml)
• Tablet Ferrous fumarate 200 mg has 65 mg of elemental iron per tablet• Chronic blood loss
• Increase iron demand – prematurity, growth
• Malabsorption
• Worm infestation
• Inadequate dietary intake
• Non-compliance
• Inadequate iron dosage
• Unrecognized blood loss
• Impaired GI absorption
• Incorrect diagnosis
• Rare conditions e.g. IRIDA (Iron Resistant Iron Deficiency Anaemia- these patients are resistant to oral/
im iron, may partially respond to parenteral iron)
• Generally, blood transfusion is NOT required in chronic Iron Deficiency Anaemia unless patient is
• In overt cardiac decompensation
• Severely symptomatic (e.g. FTT, poor weight gain).
• In patients with chronic anaemia, it is usually safe to plan the transfusion the next morning (during 
working hours) and take necessary blood investigations prior to transfusion (e.g. FBP , Hb analysis, HIV etc.)
• In severe anaemia (Hb < 4 g/dL) low volume RBC cells (< 5mls/kg) is preferred. It might be necessary to 
transfuse slowly over 4-6 hours with IV Frusemide (1mg/kg) midway.Refer Chapter 1: Normal Values in Children for Hematological Parameters for Varying Ages

from the usual 120 days, leading to increased production of unconjugated bilirubin and jaundice 
clinically. As the RBC survival decreases, the bone marrow responds by increasing RBC production, so 
there is increased reticulocytosis.
2. 3 cardinal sign to confirm haemolysis
a. Anaemia
b. Hyperbilirubinaemia
c. Reticulocytosis
3. Children with haemolytic anaemia usually present with pallor, lethargy, and fatigue. Other indicators 
include darkened urine, scleral icterus, and jaundice.
4. Other important history
 ͳFamily history of gallstone disease, splenectomy with family history of Hereditary Spherocytosis
 ͳRecurrent pain in Sickle Cell Disease
 ͳBleeding, oncological, rheumatological (joint pain, rashes etc), menstruation, and the birth history 
are important.
 ͳCurrent and past medications including any supplements are also important as oxidant drugs can 
cause haemolysis, especially in patients with G6PD deficiency
5. Full Blood Count + differential counts, Peripheral Blood Film (PBF) and reticulocyte count are essential in 
diagnosing haemolytic anaemia. Some other important investigations are serum bilirubin, Coombs Test 
and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH).  
6. Haptoglobin is not well synthesized in infants and is an acute phase reactant, and thus is not helpful in 
evaluating autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, but can be used for older children
7. G6PD levels can be falsely normal during an acute haemolytic episode because reticulocytes have 
higher G6PD activity than mature red blood cells, which necessitates repeat testing after the resolution 
of haemolysis, if there is high clinical suspicion of G6PD deficiency.
8. In case of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, screen for Primary Immunodeficiency Disorder and 
rheumatologic disease (frequently indicated in teenager females).HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA IN CHILDREN

2. For warm autoimmune haemolytic anemia (Warm AIHA), corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. 
You may consult Paediatric Hemato-oncologist before starting oral prednisolone 1-2mg/kg/day and 
taper down slowly over 4-6 months.  Approximately 80% of patients have a good initial response to 
corticosteroid.
3. In refractory cases, when haemoglobin has not been stabilized over 10g/dL within 3-4 weeks post 
initiation of treatment, or when there is difficulty in weaning the child off steroids, second line options 
include rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody), splenectomy, and immunosuppressive agents (includes 
azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, etc.) 
4. For cold AIHA, it is usually occurs following a viral infection. Therapy is generally supportive by keeping 
the child warm and use in-line blood warmer during transfusion. Autoantibody is transient and 
recurrence is rare.
5. In Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia, if the patient is clinically stable and responding to therapy, 
transfusions may not be required.
6. When the anemia is severe and becomes symptomatic (neurologic signs such as confusion), transfusion 
is urgently required. When compatible units cannot be located, clinicians and transfusion specialist 
should cooperate and do not delay the transfusions.
7. If there is presence of microangiopathic haemolytic Anaemia in PBF with thrombocytopenia and acute 
renal failure, think of Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome. It is life threatening. Treat the underlying infection 
and require close monitoring in ICU setting. The patient may need renal replacement therapy.

Chapter 75:
Thalassaemia
• The term ‘thalassaemia’ refers to a group of blood diseases characterised by decreased or absent 
synthesis of one or more of the normal globin chains. 
• According to the chain whose synthesis is impaired, the thalassaemias are called α, β, γ, δ, δβ or εγδβ 
thalassaemias. 
• The most relevant types are α and β thalassaemias, resulting from the decrease of one of the two types 
of polypeptide chains (α or β) that form the normal adult human haemoglobin molecule (Hb A, α2β2).
• As autosomal recessive conditions, heterozygotes of either α or β thalassaemia are usually 
asymptomatic and require no treatment. 
• Homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for thalassaemia alleles result in thalassaemia syndromes 
or diseases. 
• In addition, interactions of thalassaemia and corresponding haemoglobinopathies e.g. Hb E, Hb C or 
Hb S with β thalassaemia or Hb Constant Spring (Hb CS) with α thalassaemia also give rise to various 
thalassaemia syndromes.
• Currently, based on their clinical severity and transfusion requirement, these thalassaemia syndromes 
can be classified phenotypically into two main groups (as shown in figure 1);
• Transfusion-Dependent Thalassaemias (TDTs)
• Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassaemias (NTDTs)
Figure 1: Phenotypic classification of thalassaemia syndromes based on clinical severity
and transfusion requirement.
• The TDTs require regular blood transfusion to survive and without adequate transfusion support, they 
would suffer several complications and a short life span.
• This category includes patients with β thalassaemia major, severe Hb E/β thalassaemia, transfusion 
-dependent Hb H disease or Hb H hydrops fetalis and surviving Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis.
• The groups of NTDT patients include β thalassaemia intermedia, Hb E/β thalassaemia and Hb H disease.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY• β thalassaemia includes three main forms: 
• thalassaemia major
• thalassaemia intermedia and
• thalassaemia minor also called ‘β thalassaemia carrier’, ‘β thalassaemia trait’ or‘heterozygous β 
thalassaemia. 
• Subjects with β thalassaemia major are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for β0 or β+ 
genes.
• Subjects with thalassaemia intermedia are mostly homozygotes or compound heterozygotes
• Subjects with thalassaemia minor are mostly heterozygotes.
• Clinical presentation of β thalassaemia major usually occurs between 6 and 24 months of age with 
severe microcytic anaemia, mild jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. 
• Affected infants fail to thrive and become progressively pale. 
• Feeding problems, irritability, recurrent bouts of fever due to a hypermetabolic state or intercurrent 
infection, and progressive enlargement of the abdomen caused by spleen and liver enlargement may 
occur.
• The clinical picture in patients who are untreated or poorly transfused, is characterised by;  
• growth retardation
• pallor
• jaundice
• poor musculature
• genu valgum
• hepatosplenomegaly
• leg ulcers
• Development of masses from extramedullary haematopoiesis, and skeletal changes resulting from 
expansion of the bone marrow. Skeletal changes include;
• deformities in the long bones of the legs
• typical craniofacial changes: thalassaemic facies (bossing of the skull, prominent malar 
eminence, depression of the bridge of the nose and hypertrophy of the maxillae, which tends to 
expose the upper teeth).β thalassaemia

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY• α-thalassaemias are inherited disorders characterised by reduced or suppressed production of α globin 
chains. 
• The human α globin genes are duplicated and located at the telomeric end of the short arm of 
chromosome 16. 
• α thalassaemia is caused most commonly by deletions of large DNA fragments that involve one or both 
α globin genes.
• Hb H disease patients with certain non-deletional mutations, specifically Hb Pak Num Po (ααPNP), Hb 
Quong Sze (αQZα) or Hb Adana (αCD59α) have a severe phenotype that mimics that of α thalassaemia 
major:   
• early onset of anaemia (at birth or within 6 month of birth)
• marked anaemia (Hb <50 g/l)
• huge hepatosplenomegaly
• failure to thrive.• When there are deletions or non-deletional abnormalities of three globin genes, the affected individual 
would have only one functional gene. 
• In general, patients with non-deletional Hb H disease have more severe disease than patients with 
deletional for example, co-inheritance of Hb Constant Spring and the deletion of two α genes results 
in a severe form of Hb H disease in which up to 20% of patients require frequent blood transfusion and 
splenectomy.
• the most severe clinical manifestation of α thalassaemia, is generally associated with the absence of all 
four α globin genes, severe fetal anaemia and death in utero. α thalassaemia

• The diagnosis of thalassaemia relies on measuring red blood cell indices and haemoglobin analysis and 
assessing the clinical severity of anaemia. 
• Molecular genetic testing may be useful for predicting the clinical phenotype and enabling 
presymptomatic diagnosis of at-risk family members and prenatal diagnosis. 
• The diagnostic criteria for thalassaemia and hemoglobinopathies are summarized in Figure 2.

Section 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGYTREATMENT OF THALASSAEMIA
• The aim of blood transfusion in thalassaemia is to deliver an effective and safe transfusion regimen 
while minimizing the burden of transfusion therapy on everyday life. 
• An effective transfusion regimen will result in:
• good growth and development
• good energy levels
• sufficient suppression of intra and extramedullary haematopoiesis.
• Blood transfusion therapy is decided upon the following criteria:
• Confirmed diagnosis of thalassaemia.    
• Laboratory criteria: 
• Haemoglobin level (Hb) <70 g/L on 2 occasions, > 2 weeks apart (excluding all other contributory 
causes such as infections)
• Clinical criteria irrespective of haemoglobin level: Haemoglobin > 70 g/L with any of the following:
• Significant symptoms of anaemia
• Poor growth/failure to thrive
• Complications from excessive intramedullary haematopoiesis such as pathological fractures and 
facial changes.
• Clinically significant extramedullary haematopoiesis
Key recommendation
• The diagnosis of thalassaemia should be confirmed with appropriate clinical and laboratory methods 
before the onset of transfusions .
• Before first transfusion, extended red-cell antigen typing of patients at least for D, C, c, E, e and Kell and 
if available a full red-cell pheno/genotype should be performed.
• Leucodepleted packed red cells should be used where available. 
• Transfusions should be performed every 2–4 weeks, maintaining pre-transfusion haemoglobin above 
9.0–10.5 g/dL or up to 11.0–12.0 g/dL for patients with cardiac complications.
• A record of red-cell antibodies, transfusion reactions and annual transfusion requirements should be 
kept for each patient.
Iron overload and iron chelation
• Major cause of iron overload
• Blood transfusion therapy in TDT,
• Increased GI absorption in NTDT.
Diagnosis and monitoring of iron overload
The diagnosis and monitoring of iron overload are based on the complementary use of the following 
parameters:
• Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is measured at least every 3 months (1–3 months). 
• Target value is currently between 500 and 1000 μg/L. 
• Measuring the trends in SF is a more reliable indicator for adjusting therapy than the use of single values.
• Liver iron concentration (LIC) is measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods.
• Normal LIC values are up to 1.8 mg/g dry weight. 
• Sustained high LIC above 15 mg/g dry weight have been linked to worsening prognosis, liver fibrosis 
progression, or liver function abnormalities.
• The frequency of LIC assessment should be guided by its level and its rate of change:
• Stable levels in the range 3–7 mg/g dry weight (dw): Every 1 or 2 years
• Levels >7 mg/g dw: yearly
• Levels falling rapidly or <3 mg/g dw: 6–12 monthlyBlood transfusions

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY• Patients should be also regularly screened for iron-mediated damage including cardiac dysfunction, 
diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
The aims of iron chelation therapy are as follows:
• Prevention therapy:  to maintain safe levels of body iron at all times, by balancing iron intake from blood 
transfusion with iron excretion by chelation (iron balance).
• Rescue therapy:  to remove excess iron stored in the body.
• Emergency therapy:  to urgently intensify iron chelation in case of iron-induced heart failure.
• Dose adjustment of therapy:  to adjust dosing and treatment regimens to changing circumstances 
identified by careful monitoring of body iron and its distribution; monitoring is important to avoid:
• under-chelation with increased iron toxicity; or 
• over-chelation and increased chelator toxicity.
• Adherence to therapy:  to adhere to prescribed regular regimen; intermittent high-dose chelation can 
induce negative iron balance but does not provide continuous protection from labile iron and also risks 
increased toxicity from the iron chelator.• Myocardial iron is assessed by T2* cardiac MRI .The frequency of cardiac MRI scan should be guided by 
myocardial iron level, for example:
• Stable T2* >20 ms: 2 yearly
• T2* 10–19 ms: yearly
• T2* <10 ms: 6 monthly
It is particularly important to measure cardiac function when cardiac iron is high (eg, T2* <10 ms), 
as this is associated with a high risk of deteriorating function and heart failure and requires urgent 
intensification of chelation.
Target organ function and other parameters
Iron chelation therapy Myocardial iron
• Uncontrolled transfusional iron overload increases the risks of heart failure, endocrine damage, liver 
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma .
• Chelation therapy is an effective treatment modality in improving survival, decreasing the risk of heart 
failure, and decreasing morbidities from transfusion-induced iron overload .
• Chelation therapy at the correct doses and frequency can balance iron excretion with iron accumulation 
from transfusion
• Direction of change in body iron in response to transfusion and chelation can usually but not always be 
estimated from the trend in serum ferritin.
• Prevention of iron accumulation using chelation therapy is preferable to rescue treatment because iron-
mediated damage is often irreversible, and removal of storage iron by chelation is slow—particularly 
after it has escaped the liver.
• Response to chelation is dependent on the dose applied and the duration of exposure.
• Response to chelation is affected by the rate of blood transfusion 
• Cardiac iron accumulates later than liver iron, and is rare before the age of 8 years, affecting a subset of 
patients.
• Chelation of storage iron from the liver tends to be faster than from myocardium 
• Cardiac storage iron concentration is directly related to the risk of heart failure, which can be reliably 
estimated by MRI (e.g. cardiac T2*), provided the centre performing the measurement uses a validated 
method that has been independently calibrated.
• Chelation can reverse iron-mediated cardiac dysfunction rapidly (within weeks) by rapid chelation of 
labile iron, if 24 hours chelation cover is achieved.
• Chelation therapy removes myocardial storage iron slowly (months or years).
• Over-chelation increases side effects from chelation therapy, and doses should therefore be decreased 
as serum ferritin or liver iron levels fall (demonstrated most clearly with DFO).
• The optimal chelation regime must be tailored for the individual and will vary with their current clinical 
situation.
• Chelation therapy will not be effective if it is not taken regularly—a key aspect of chelation 
management is to work with patients to optimize adherence.Key points and recommendations

Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
• In thalassemia patients, HSCT is cost-effective when compared to life-long supportive therapy
• HSCT should be offered to thalassemia patients and their parents at an early age, before 
complications due to iron overload have developed, if an HLA identical sibling is available.
• Either bone marrow or cord blood from an HLA identical sibling can be used.
• A matched unrelated donor can be used, provided that high compatibility criteria for both HLA class I 
and II loci are present.
• Haploidentical HSCT in thalassemia can be considered in experienced HSCT centres in the context of 
well-designed clinical trials.
• Myeloablative conditioning regimens should always be used for standard transplantation.
• Post-transplant care should include all transplant and thalassemia related complications.

Immune Thrombocytopaenia (ITP) is an acquired isolated thrombocytopenia due to   immune-mediated 
destruction of otherwise normal platelets at a rate that exceeds production. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, 
patient with ITP should have normal history and examination aside from bleeding symptoms, normal FBC 
and other investigation aside from thrombocytopenia.
• Mild (77% of children)
• Few petechiae
• Small (<5cm) bruises
• Epistaxis, stopped by applied pressure within 20 minutes.
• Moderate (20% of children)
• Numerous petechiae
• Large (>5cm) bruises.
• Epistaxis longer than 20 minutes.
• Intermittent bleeding from gums, lips, buccal, oropharynx or gastrointestinal tract. 
• Hypermenorrhagia, haematemesis, haematuria, melena – without hypotension and falling Hb<20g/l
• Severe (3% of children)
• Epistaxis requiring nasal packing or cautery.
• Continuous bleeding from gums, buccal, oropharynx. Suspected internal
• haemorrhage (lung, muscle, joint). 
• Hypermenorrhagia, haematemesis, haematuria, melena – leading to hypotension and falling 
Hb>20g/l
• Life-threatening (rare, 0.1%-0.9% of children)
• Intracranial haemorrhage or continuous or high volume bleeding resulting in hypotension or 
prolonged capillary refill and requiring fluid resuscitation or blood transfusion• Newly diagnosed ITP – remission occurs before 3 months (50-70%)
• Persistent ITP – low platelet count beyond 3 months – 1 year (20-30%)
• Chronic ITP – symptoms persist beyond 1 year (10-20%)
• ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibody mediated immunologic destruction of 
normal platelets (mainly occurring in the spleen), in response to an unknown stimulus.
• Onset is usually abrupt / acute.
• Duration from onset of thrombocytopenia to normalisation of platelet counts can be a few days to 6 
months (average 3 weeks).
• Majority will give a history of a viral infection in the preceding 2-4 weeks.
• Spectrum of bleeding severity ranges from cutaneous bleeding, i.e., petechiae --> mucosal bleeds (gum 
bleeds, epistaxis, gross haematuria)
--> life threatening bleeds i.e. intracranial haemorrhage.Grading of Disease SeverityNomenclature

Section 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY• Diagnosis is based on:
• History
• Physical examination 
• absence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy.
• Blood counts: 
• isolated thrombocytopenia, with normal haemoglobin and white cell count.
• PBF: 
• normal apart from reduced, occasional larger platelets, no abnormal cells.
• Other tests may be indicated when there is atypical presentation. The tests would depend on the 
differential diagnoses suspected in the thrombocytopenic child.
• Bone marrow examination is not necessary to diagnose ITP if the treating physician is certain that 
the personal history, family history, physical examination, complete blood count, and peripheral 
blood smear are typical of ITP .
• Examples of abnormalities that might indicate an alternate diagnosis rather than ITP are:-
• Fever or bone or joint pain
• A family history of low platelets or easy bruising
• Risk factors for HIV
• Skeletal or soft-tissue morphologic abnormalities
• Non-petechial rash
• Lymphadenopathy
• Abnormal Hb, WBC count, or morphology not typical of ITP
• Consider hospitalization in:
• Severe life-threatening bleeding (e.g. ICH) regardless of platelet count.
• Platelet count < 20 x 109/L with evidence of bleeding.
• Platelet count < 20 x 109/L without bleeding but inaccessible to health care.
• Lack of confidence in homecare.
• Advise: 
• Precaution with physical activities especially small children.
• Avoid contact sports.
• Seek immediate medical attention if significant bleed.
• Avoid aspirin /NSAIDs.
• Treatment is generally indicated if there is: 
• Life threatening bleeding episode (e.g. ICH) regardless of platelet count.
• Platelet count < 20 x 109/L with mucosal bleeding.
• Platelet count < 10 x 109/L with any bleeding.
• Choice of treatment includes: 
• Oral Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days then taper off over 5 days
• (regardless of response)
• Oral Prednisolone 4 mg/kg/day for 3 - 4 days
• IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.8 g/kg/dose for a single dose, round up to the nearest bottle to avoid 
wastage• Most children remit spontaneously. 
• The platelet count is usually < 20 x 109/L at diagnosis.

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY• Notes regarding treatment:
• Treatment do not resolve the condition faster, but can temporarily raise the platelet count much 
quicker compared to no treatment. There is no evidence that these treatment reduce bleeding 
complications/mortality/influence progression to chronic ITP .
• Side effects of IVIG are:-common (15 - 75%): fever, flushing, headache, nausea, aseptic meningitis 
and possible transmission of blood borne infections e.g. Hepatitis C (older preparations).
• Steroids should not be continued if there is no response or if there is a rapid relapse after 
withdrawal. The long-term side-effects in a child outweigh the benefits.
• Treatment is directed at the clinical status of the patient i.e. treat the child, not the platelet count.
• Intracranial Haemorrhage (ICH)
• Is the most feared complication of ITP .
• Incidence in a child with ITP is between 0.1 - 0.5%.
• The risk is highest with platelet count < 20 x 109/L, history of head trauma, aspirin use and presence 
of cerebral arteriovenous malformation.
• 50% of all ICH occurs after 1 month of presentation, 30% after 6 months.
• Early treatment with steroid or IVIG may not prevent late onset ICH.
• Emergency treatment 
• Emergency treatment of ITP with severe bleeding, i.e. severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleed 
causing drop in Hb or ICH includes:
• IV Methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
• IVIG 0.8g - 1g/kg as a single dose – calculated to nearest bottle of IVIG. (usually 3 grams/bottle)
• Combination of IVIG and methylprednisolone in life threatening conditions.
• Platelet transfusion in life threatening haemorrhage: 8 - 12 units/m2 BSA (2 to 3 folds more 
than usual units) as the platelets will be consumed by the haemorrhage to form blood clots and 
will reduce further circulating platelets.
• Consider emergency splenectomy if other modalities fail.
• Neurosurgical intervention maybe indicated in ICH.
• In children with ITP lasting ≥3 months who have non-life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or 
diminished health-related quality of life and do not respond to either IVIG or steroid, the ASH guideline 
panel suggests the following options for second-line therapies presented in the order they should be 
pursued :
• Thrombopoietin receptor agonist (eltrombopag or romiplostim)
• Rituximab

Haemophilia
• Haemophilia is a group of inherited blood disorders in which there is a life-long defect in the clotting 
mechanism. 
• The most common types of haemophilia are:
• Haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) 
• Haemophilia B (factor FIX deficiency). 
• They are inherited as X-linked recessive traits; therefore, males are affected and females are carriers.
• Females can be affected as well. 
• In 30% of cases, no family history is obtainable because of spontaneous new mutation.
• Person with haemophilia (PWH) can present with the following symptoms:
• easy bruising in early childhood
• ‘spontaneous’ bleeding particularly into the soft tissues, muscles, joints and gums
• excessive bleeding following trauma or surgery
• A newborn or infant with haemophilia can present with spontaneous intracranial bleed. 
• A child may also present with post-vaccination or vitamin K injection haematoma.
• A positive family history is present in two-thirds of patients while another one-third may have 
spontaneous mutation.
• The most common site of bleeding in haemophilia is the joints (70 - 80%), especially hinged joints (e.g. 
ankles, knees and elbows).
• Bleeding is considered:
• serious if it occurs in the
• joints (haemarthrosis)
• muscles, especially deep compartments (iliopsoas, calf and forearm)
• mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose and genitourinary tract
• life-threatening if it occurs in the
• neck or throat (including floor of the mouth)
• intracranial
• gastrointestinal
• If APTT is prolonged & there is positive family history of haemophilia, proceed to perform FVIII or FIX 
factor assay based on Haemophilia type in the family.
• Otherwise, mixing study should be done first.Diagnostic Investigations:CLINICAL PRESENTATION

joint damage & other potential serious & life-threatening events in haemophilia.
• The optimal approach to haemophilia treatment is using prophylactic therapy to prevent bleeds & 
chronic joint damage, hence reducing short & long-term complications. 
• Prophylaxis should be given to all persons with severe haemophilia even at a low dose.
• Primary prophylaxis is preferred in PWH & should commence after first large joint bleed, intracranial

• poor response to replacement therapy
• recovery assays are not as expected
• increase bleeding episodes despite optimal prophylaxis
• Inhibitor should be screened:
• at regular interval
• for children-once every five exposure days until 20 exposure days, then every 10 exposure days 
between 21 & 50 exposure days, then at least twice a year until 150 exposure days, there after 
yearly.
• for adults with >150 exposure days, every 6 - 12 months
• after intensive treatment for >5 days, within 4 weeks of the last infusion
• prior to surgery
• Treatment of bleeding episode in Haemophilia A and B with inhibitor
• The main treatment option for bleeding episodes in PWH with inhibitors is bypassing agents e.g. 
rFVIIa (recombinant Factor VII activated) or aPCC.(activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrate). 
• These agents bypass the coagulation pathway that normally utilises FVIII. 
• rFVIIa and aPCC are equally effective and well tolerated with no increase in thromboembolic risk.
The doses:
• rFVIIa is 90 - 120 μg/kg rounded up to the nearest vial size, given every 2-3 hours until haemostasis 
achieved. 
• Equivalent effectiveness and safety have been demonstrated with a single dose of 270 μg/kg vs three 
doses of 90 μg/kg.
• aPCC can be used at doses of 50 - 100 IU/kg given every 8 - 12 hours, but should not exceed 200 IU/kg/
day.Special precautions on certain bleeding sites.

Section 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGYAnalgesia
• There is rapid pain relief in haemarthroses once missing factor concentrate is infused.
• If analgesia is required, avoid intramuscular injections.
• Do not use aspirin or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as they will affect platelet 
function.
• Paracetamol with or without opioids can provide adequate pain control.
Dental care
• Good dental hygiene is important as dental caries are a regular source of bleeding.
• Dental clearance with factor replacement will be required in severe cases.
Immunisations
• All immunizations should be given as per scheduled and given subcutaneously.
• Avoid given factor replacement on the same day of immunization as it post the risk of inhibitor 
development.
Haemophilia Society
• All haemophiliacs should be registered with a patient support group e.g. Haemophilia Society.
• They should have a medic-alert bracelet/chain which identifies them as haemophiliacs and carry a book 
in which the diagnosis, classification of severity, types of bleeds and admissions can be recorded.
Novel therapies and advances in Haemophilia treatment
• Non-factor replacement e.g Emicizumab given subcutaneously, indicated for prophylaxis both for 
haemophilia A with and without inhibitor. 
• Other non-factor replacement like futisiran, concizumab and Anti-TFPI are in the pipeline.
• Gene therapy-provide cure for haemophilia.• Primary goal of treatment haemophilia with inhibitor is eradication of inhibitor by ITI.
• Consultation with Paediatric Haematologist is necessary for planning of ITI.
• Initiation of ITI should be postponed until the inhibitor titre has dropped to <10 BU (Bethesda Unit).
• An inhibitor titre of <10 BU before ITI initiation positively affects both the likelihood of success and the 
time required to achieve tolerance.
• Do consider starting ITI regardless of the inhibitor titre if:
• the inhibitor titre does not fall below 10 BU within a 1- to 2-year period of close observation or
• a severe life- or limb-threatening bleeding event occurs
• Prerequisite for starting ITI to ensure no interruption of treatment for best response:
• commitment from PWH with inhibitor/care giver
• good venous access
• adequate budgetIMMUNE TOLERANCE INDUCTION (ITI)

Oncology Emergencies
• To be instituted in every case of acute leukaemia or Iymphoma prior to induction chemotherapy.
• Hydration: Ensure adequate hydration in all patients.
• In high risk patients, hyper hydration of 125ml/m² /hr or 3000ml/m² /day .
• NO ADDED POTASSIUM in drip.
• Allopurinol 10mg/kg/day, max 300mg/day.
• Rasburicase in patients with high risk of developing TLS. (No allopurinol in these patients).
• Alkalization of urine with sodium bicarbonate is no longer advocated.METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
Introduction
• Pathophysiology:
Massive tumour cell death
--> rapid release of intracellular metabolites
--> exceeds excretory capacity of the kidneys
--> acute kidney injury (AKI)
• More common in Iymphoproliferative tumours with abdominal involvement (e.g. Iymphoma, leukaemia)
• Beware of giving steroids in any patients with suspected leukaemia!!!
• Can occur spontaneously even before any chemotherapy is started
Characterised by:
• Hyperuricemia: Breakdown of intracellular purines in DNA increase uric acid
• Hyperkalaemia can occur secondary to
• Tumour cell Iysis
• Renal failure from uric acid nephropathy or hyperphosphatemia
• Hyperphosphatemia with associated hypocalcaemia.
• Most commonly occurs in Iymphoproliferative disorders as phosphate content in lymphoblasts are 4 
times higher than in normal lymphocytes
• Tissue damage from CaPO₄ precipitation (When Ca X PO₄ > 60mg/dl)
• Hypocalcaemia leads to altered sensorium, photophobia, neuromuscular irritability, seizures, carpopedal 
spasm and GIT symptoms
Renal failure - cause of renal failure in the patient with TLS is multifactorial:-
• Uric acid, phosphorus and potassium are excreted by kidneys
• Lactic acidosis will facilitate uric acid crystallization and uric acid obstructive nephropathy.
• Increased phosphorus excretion causes calcium phosphate precipitation in microvasculature and tubules.
• Risk increases if renal parenchyma is infiltrated by tumour, e.g. in abdominal or renal lymphoma or 
ureteric obstruction from tumour compression/lymph nodes.Tumour Lysis Syndrome

• Defined as TWBC > 100,000/mm³ in patients with acute leukaemia.
• Symptoms are related to leukostasis, especially in acute monocytic leukaemia.
• LUNGS: Pulmonary infiltrates causing dyspnoea, hypoxaemia and right ventricular failure
• CNS: causing headache, papilledema, seizures, haemorrhage or infarct.
• Other complications: renal failure, priapism, dactylitis.
• Mechanism:
• Excessive leukocytes form aggregates and thrombi in small veins causing obstruction.
• Worsens when blood is viscous.
• Excessive leukocytes competes for oxygen; damages vessel wall causing bleeding.HAEMATOLOGICAL EMERGENCIES
Hyperleukocytosis• May occur in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
• Can occur as part of SIADH
• Common in AML
• Due to rapid cellular generation which leads to uptake of potassium into cells
• Intracellular K+ 30-40 X higher than extracellular K+
• Therefore hypokalaemia may develop after chemotherapy
• Associated with NHL (Non Hodgkin Lymphoma), Hodgkin lymphoma, rhabdoid tumours, alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.
• Treatment:
• Ensure adequate hydration
• IV Frusemide (which increases calcium excretion)• May occur in patients with Diabetes Insipidus due to brain tumours, LCH, etc.OTHER METABOLIC EMERGENCIES:
Hyponatraemia
Hypokalaemia
HypercalcaemiaHypernatremia• Treat hyperkalaemia as per institution protocol– kalimate/ resonium/ lytic cocktail.
• Diuretics as required.
• Treatment of hypocalcaemia depends on the phosphate level:
• If phosphate is raised, correct the high phosphate.
• If phosphate is normal /symptoms of hypokalaemia, give IV calcium correction.
• If hypocalcaemia is refractory to treatment, exclude associated hypomagnesaemia.
• Definitive treatment of established TLS is dialysis
• Haemodialysis most efficient at correcting electrolyte abnormalities.
• Peritoneal dialysis is not effective in removing phosphates.Management (Treatment)• HCO 3 makes uric acid more soluble.
• However,
 ͳCalcium phosphate precipitates in alkaline urine (esp. if pH >8).
 ͳAlkalinisation may aggravate hypocalcaemia.
• Xanthine, hypoxanthine and allantoin precipitation is not affected by pH.
• May have to delay chemotherapy until metabolic status stabilizes
• Close electrolyte monitoring: BUSE, Ca²⁺, PO₄, uric acid, creatinine, HCO 3
• Strict I/O charting. Ensure adequate urine flow once hydrated. May require frusemide.

• Rarely, malignant teratoma, thymoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma may 
present with anterior or middle mediastinal mass and obstruction.
• 50% associated with thrombosis.
• Presentation: shortness of breath, facial swelling, syncope.
Management
• Recognition of symptoms and signs of SVC obstruction.
• Avoid sedation and general anaesthesia --> significant risk of circulatory collapse or respiratory failure 
with general anaesthesia or sedation.
• Avoid upper limb venepunctures as may cause bleeding due to increased intravascular pressure / 
aggravate SVC obstruction.
• Tissue diagnosis should be established by the least invasive method possible.
• Consider obtaining diagnosis by BMA, biopsy of superficial lymph node under LA or measurement of 
serum markers, e.g. alpha-fetoprotein.
• If tissue diagnosis impossible, treat empirically based on the most likely diagnosis.
• Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may make histologic diagnosis difficult (as early as 48 hours) --> biopsy 
as soon as patient is fit / safe.
• NHL - Primary mode of treatment is with steroids and chemotherapy.
• Consider radiotherapy for symptomatic treatment in severe cases.• AML (especially AML M3) is associated with an initial bleeding diathesis
• Consumptive coagulopathy is due to release of a tissue factor with pro-coagulant activity from cells
• The use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has circumvented this complication
• Management
• Platelet transfusions: 6 units/m² should increase platelets by 50,000/mm³
• Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate
• Vitamin K
• Febrile episodes in oncology patients must be treated with urgency especially if associated with 
neutropenia. Usually bacteraemia or dissemi- nated fungal infections occur when the absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) <500 /mm³.
• Risk increases maximally if ANC < 100 /mm³ and greatly reduced if the ANC > 1000 /mm³.
Management (Refer Algorithm on next page)• Thrombocytopenia
• Severe anaemia
SUPERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION

Febrile neutropeniaOther haematological emergenciesManagement
• Adequate hydration/ hyper hydration at 125mls/m2/hour
• Facilitate excretion of toxic metabolites.
• Reduce blood viscosity.
• Avoid increasing blood viscosity
• Exercise caution in use of packed cell transfusion and diuretics.
• During induction in patients with hyperleukocytosis, keep platelet count >20 000/mm³ and coagulation 
profile near normal.
• Exchange transfusions and leukopheresis should not be used alone as rapid rebound usually occurs. 
Concurrent chemotherapy should therefore be initiated soonest possible.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 12       HAEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGYOther considerations:
• If central venous line (CVL) is present, culture from both lumens; add anti-Staph cover e.g. Cloxacillin.
• Repeated physical examination to look for new signs and symptoms or clues to possible sources.
• Close monitoring of patient’s well-being --> vital signs, perfusion, BP , I/O.
• Repeat cultures if indicated.
• Investigative parameters, FBC, CRP , BUSE as necessary.
• In presence of oral thrush or other evidence of fungal infection, start antifungals.
• Monitor renal function closely as some patients may have recently been given potentially nephrotoxic 
chemotherapy, e.g. cisplatin.
Management
• Usually conservative with broad spectrum antibiotics covering gram -ve organisms and anaerobes (use 
metronidazole).
• Mortality 20-100%.
• Criteria for surgical intervention:
• Persistent gastrointestinal bleeding despite resolution of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and 
correction of coagulation abnormalities.
• Evidence of perforation.
• Clinical deterioration suggesting uncontrolled sepsis (controversial).• A necrotizing colitis localised to the caecum occurring in neutropenic patients.
• Bacterial invasion of mucosa causing inflammation --> full thickness infarction and perforation.
• Usual organisms are Clostridium and Pseudomonas.
• X-ray shows nonspecific thickening of gut wall --> pneumatosis intestinalis
+/- evidence of free gas in abdomen.Typhlitis
Prolonged compression leads to permanent neurologic sequelae
• Epidural extension: Lymphoma, neuroblastoma and soft tissue sarcoma.
• Intradural: Spinal cord tumour.
Presentation
• Back pain: localized or radicular, aggravated by movement, straight leg raising, and neck flexion.
• Later: weakness, sensory loss, loss of bladder and bowel continence
• Diagnosed by MRI or CT.
Management
• Urgent laminectomy (if deterioration within 72 hours)
• If paralysis present > 72 hours, chemotherapy is the better option if tumour is chemo sensitive, e.g. 
lymphoma, neuroblastoma and Ewing’s tumour. This avoids vertebral damage. Onset of action of 
chemotherapy is similar to radiotherapy.
• Prior IV Dexamethasone 0.5mg/kg 6 hourly to reduce oedema. Caution when dealing with possible 
lymphoma.
• +/- Radiotherapy.Spinal Cord CompressionNEUROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS

• Use of anticoagulant potentially detrimental.Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
Acute Pancreatitis
ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) syndrome• Can result from direct or metastatic spread of tumour, antineoplastic agent or haematological 
abnormality.
• L-Asparaginase is associated with venous or lateral and sagittal sinus thrombosis caused by rebound 
hypercoagulable state.
• AML especially APML (acute promyelocytic leukaemia) associated with DIVC (disseminated intravascular 
coagulation) and CVA, due to the release of procoagulants.
• Should be considered in patients on L-Asparaginase and steroids and complaining of abdominal pain.
• Careful examination plus measurement of serum amylase and ultrasound abdomen.
• Characterised by: fever, respiratory distress, oedema, pleural/pericardial effusion, and hypotension.
• Pathophysiology: due to leukostasis associated with ATRA induced multiplication and differentiation of 
leukaemic promyelocytes.
• Treatment: Dexamethasone 0.5-1mg/kg/dose bd, maximum dose 20 mg bd.MISCELLANOUS EMERGENCIESIncreased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and brain herniation
• Cause: Infratentorial tumours causing blockage of the 3rd or 4th ventricles such as medulloblastomas, 
astrocytomas and ependymomas
• Signs and symptoms vary according to age/site
• Infant - vomiting, lethargy, seizures, symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased head 
circumference.
• Older children - early morning headaches +/- vomiting, poor school performance.
• Cerebellum: ipsilateral hypotonia and ataxia.
• Herniation of cerebellar tonsil: head tilt and neck stiffness.
• Tumours near 3rd ventricle: craniopharyngioma, germinoma, optic glioma, hypothalamic and 
pituitary tumours --> visual loss, increased ICP (intracranial pressure) and hydrocephalus.
• Aqueduct of Sylvius obstruction due to pineal tumour: raised ICP , Parinaud’s syndrome (impaired

• Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
• Aplastic anaemia
• Rheumatic disease i.e. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, SLE
• Metabolic disease i.e. Gaucher
• Myelodysplastic syndrome
• Viral infection e.g. EBV or CMV
• Initial investigations:
For diagnosis  
• Full Blood Count (FBC) may have anaemia and/thrombocytopenia 
• Total White Count (TWC) may be normal, low or high 
• Peripheral blood film (PBF) may shows blast cells, therefore absent of blast in PBF does not rule out ALL.
• Bone Marrow Aspirate (Bone Marrow Aspiration) and trephine biopsy smear 
• Immunophenotyping 
• Cytogenetics 
• Molecular mutation studies 
• Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) examination for blast cells
For assessment and monitoring  
• CXR to look for mediastinal masses 
• Tumour lysis profile: BUSE especially serum K+,  serum Creatinine, Uric Acid, PO4, Ca2+, HCO3 
• Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) – assess degree of leukaemic cell burden and risk of tumour lysis 
• Coagulation profile if the child is toxic or bleeding. 
• Blood cultures and septic workup if febrile. 
• Hepatitis B/C, HIV and VZ IgG screen pre transfusion and pre treatment.

Treatment 
Maintenance therapy • Overall cure rates for childhood ALL are over 80%.
• Generally depends on:- Prognostic groups, based on clinical and laboratory features.
• Patient should receive treatment in centres with paediatric oncologists 
• Availability of other special diagnostic tests 
• Use of standard treatment protocols 
• Level of supportive care available  
• Unfavourable if there are clinical features indicating high risk 
• Age > 10 years old and infants 
• Very high WBC count at diagnosis 
• Molecular characteristics of the leukaemic blasts, e.g. Philadelphia chromosome t (9; 22) (q34; q11); 
BCR-ABL; P185BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. 
• Day 8 peripheral blast cell count > 1000 x 109/L. 
• Poor response to induction chemotherapy based on subsequent BMA/ MRD (Minimal Residual 
Disease) reassessment where available.
• The regimes or treatment protocols used vary according to treating institutions: 
• BFM – Germany protocol
• MRC – UK protocol
• MASPORE (Malaysia-Singapore)
• CCG/COG – USA protocol 
• Generally, chemotherapy regimen consists of Induction, CNS treatment/prophylaxis, Consolidation/
intensification and Maintenance phases.
• Duration is for a total of 2 years (MRC-UK is 2 years for girls and 2.5 years for boys).
• Maintenance therapy usually starts about 2 weeks after completion of consolidation/intensification 
regime. For all patients, the total duration of therapy including Maintenance is 24 months (104 weeks) 
from start of therapy at initial diagnosis. 
• General guidelines for children with ALL on maintenance chemotherapy
• Check height, weight and calculate surface area (BSA/m2) every visit and adjust drug dosages 
accordingly.
• To calculate BSA = √ [Height (cm) x Weight (kg) / 3600]
• Check FBC fortnightly for the first 1-2 months after starting maintenance chemotherapy, and 
monthly after that if stable
• Consider doing BMA if counts are repeatedly low or relapse suspected. 2/3 of relapses occur within 
the first year of stopping treatment. CNS relapse usually manifests as headache, vomiting, abnormal 
sensorium or hypothalamic symptoms (hyperphagia and abnormal weight gain). Testicular relapse 
presents as painless testicular swelling, usually unilateral.
• If TWC < 1.5 x 109/L or ANC < 0.8 x 109/L or ALC < 0.8 x 109/L or platelets < 75 x 109/L:
• Reduce tablet 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and oral methotrexate (MTX) dose by 50%
• Once counts are above those levels:
• Increase 6-MP and MTX back to 75% of normal dose.
• Review the patent in 1 week
• If counts are acceptable, increase back to 100% of normal dose.• Different institutions and protocols have different regimes for maintenance chemotherapy.
So it is important to know the requirements of the various protocols
• As a general rule, chemotherapy is adjusted to maintain
• TWC at 1.5 - 3 X 109/L 
• ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) at or more than 0.5 X 109/L
• ALC (Absolute Lymphocyte Count) at or more than 0.3 X 109/L

• Restart drugs at 50% dose once neutrophil count have recovered > 0.5 x 109/L 
• Increase back gradually to 75% and later 100% if counts are acceptable
• Febrile infections: 
• If the blood counts are sufficient and the patient is in good general conditions, therapy should be 
resumed (possibly at reduced dose) when the patient has been free from fever for one day.
• Liver toxicity:
• GOT/GPT > 10- 20 x UNL and rising (steadily high levels can be tolerated) and/or bilirubin > 3 x UNL. 
• Consider dose reduction or stop 6-MP and MTX. 
• Investigate for causes of liver dysfunction and monitor LFT. 
• Restart at reduced dose and increase as tolerated
• Mucositis: 
• Usually related to MTX and may mainly develop when the MTX dose is high or in patients with 
Down Syndrome. 
• Reduce MTX dose while keeping 6-MP until improvement and restart at full dose.
• Initate supportive treatment with mouthwash and antifungal treatment.
• Severe diarrhoea and vomiting:
• Stop both drugs. 
• Restart at 50% dose when better and return to full dose when tolerated
• Anaemia:
• Hb is usually stable during maintenance chemotherapy, although repeatedly low Hb 
alone may be due to 6MP intolerance.  
• Some patents may require transfusion if anaemia occurs early in the course of maintenance therapy.
• Standard doses of 6-MP and MTX are to be maintained as much as possible. The dose ratio 6-MP:MTX 
should usually be 2.5:1.
• Consider sending blood for Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme deficiency screening if available. 
• Children with homozygous TPMT deficiency can have profound myelosuppression due to 6-MP . 
• Routinely used as prophylaxis for PJP (Pseudomonas jiroveci) except 1 week prior to and during high 
dose methotrexate therapy
• In the event of chronic cough or unexplained tachypnoea, consider PJP
• If CXR shows interstitial pneumonitis: -
• send nasopharyngeal secretions for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia)
• Antigen detection e.g. Immunofuorescent test (IFT) or PJP PCR detecton
• Treat empirically with Cotrimoxazole (20 mg/kg/day in divided doses)
• PJP should be treated for a total of 2 weeks
• Complications of oncologic emergencies can be seen before, during and after treatment. (see Chapter 
on Oncologic Emergencies) 
• During treatment, once discharged from oncology ward, care givers must be able to recognise signs and 
symptoms that require urgent medical attention, especially infections as they can be life threatening. 
• Infections must be taken seriously (even while on maintenance therapy) as evidence suggests that 
patients are still immunocompromised up to 3 months after discontinuing chemotherapy.

• If there is significant fever (Temperature ≥ 38.5oC x 1 or ≤ 38oC x2, one hour apart) and neutropenia, 
stop all chemotherapy drugs and admit for IV antibiotics. 
• Take appropriate cultures and CXR if indicated and give IV antibiotics immediately without waiting for 
specific bacteriological confirmation. 
• Use a combination of aminoglycosides and cephalosporins to cover both gram negative and gram 
positive organisms. 
• If nosocomial infection is suspected, use the appropriate antibiotics according to your hospital’s culture 
sensitivity pattern. 
• Any fever developing within 24 hours of central venous line access should be treated as CRBSI 
(Catheter-related bloodstream infection). 
• Common organisms are the gram positive cocci. 
• Consider adding cloxacillin to the antibiotic regime. 
• Assume multiresistant bacterial sepsis when dealing with patients presenting with septic shock, 
especially if recently discharged from hospital. 
• Vancomycin is indicated if there is a long line (Hickman) or chemoport in-situ or if MRSA or 
coagulase negative Staphylococcus  infections are suspected. 
• Antifungal therapy may be indicated in prolonged neutropenia or if there is no response to antibiotics 
or if fungal infection is suspected. 
• Early and aggressive empirical therapy without waiting for blood culture results will save lives.
Children on chemotherapy should not receive any vaccinations. 
Continue their immunisation programme from where they left off after 6 months off chemotherapy. Varicella and Measles   
• Are life-threatening infections in the immunocompromised children. 
• Reinforce this information on parents when they come for follow-up. 
• If a patient is significantly/directly exposed (e.g. in the same room > 1 hour with an index case of 
varicella/measles including 3 days prior to clinical presentation ) they are at increased risk of developing 
these infections. 
• MEASLES: Give Measles Human broad-spectrum immune globulin IM 0.5ml/kg (may be divided into 2 
separate injection sites) on the same day. 
• VARICELLA / Chickenpox: Chemotherapy must be stopped on suspicion of exposure. 
• If patient develops varicella, chemotherapy should be withheld and recommenced 2 weeks after the 
last vesicle has dried. 
• For patients who develop varicella: 
• Admit, isolate and treat immediately with IV acyclovir. 
• May switch to oral acyclovir until the lesions are healed. 
• Usual treatment duration is about 10 days.
• For exposed patients: who are VZ IgG negative at diagnosis, on chemotherapy or within 6 months of 
stopping chemotherapy:- 
• VZIG should be given within 7 days of contact, if available
• If VZIG not available, consider starting oral acyclovir as post-exposure prophylaxis  
• Monitor for signs of overt varicella infection

rehydration solution (ReSoMal if available) 5ml/kg every 30 min for first 2 hours, then 5--10ml/hr up to 
max 12 hours). Close monitoring of weight gain, respiratory rate, pulse rate, urine frequency, enlarging 
liver size and stool frequency. Stop ReSoMal if signs of overhydration. 
• Electrolyte imbalance: Deficiencies of potassium and magnesium may take 2 weeks to correct. Consider 
to give extra potassium (3-4mmol/kg/day) and magnesium (0.4-0.6mol/kg/day). 
• Infection: Cover with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Penicillin or ampicillin + gentamicin or Cefuroxime). 
Metronidazole may be given in addition. Treat other infection appropriately (meningitis, pneumonia, 
malaria, parasitic infestation), e.g.: consider Cloxacillin if there are skin lesions / 3rd generation 
cephalosporins if meningitis is suspected.
• Micronutrient deficiencies are common. Consider: 
- Vitamin A  (if available, all SAM should receive single dose)
 ͳ< 6 months 50000 IU
 ͳ6 – 12 months 100000 IU
 ͳ> 12 months 200000 IU
(To give vitamin A on day 1 and repeat same dose on day 2 and 14  if there are signs of  Vitamin A 
deficiency (xerophthalmia, corneal clouding or ulceration, Bitot’s spot) or the child has complicated 
measles)
 ͳThiamine 1-2mg/kg daily for 2 weeks
 ͳIron 2-3mg/kg daily
 ͳFolic acid 5mg on day 1, then 1 mg daily
 ͳMultivitamin 5mls daily

Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD) 
• Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus with/without 
regurgitation and vomiting. 
• This is a normal physiological process occurring several times per day in healthy children. 
• Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in paediatric patients is present when reflux of gastric 
contents is the cause of troublesome symptoms and/or complications. 
# Typical symptoms of GORD in older children besides recurrent regurgitation
Warning signals  requiring investigation in infants with recurrent regurgitation or vomiting: 
• Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction or disease 
• Bilious vomiting. 
• GI bleeding: hematemesis, melaena. 
• Consistently forceful vomiting. 
• Onset of vomiting > 6 months or persistent > 12-18 months of age.
• Constipation. 
• Chronic diarrhoea. 
• Abdominal distension. • Symptoms and signs associated with reflux vary by age and are nonspecific. 
Table 1: Symptoms and signs that may be associated with GORD in infants and children 0 to 18 years old
*If excessive irritability, pain, airway signs and symptoms is the single manifestation without overt 
regurgitation, it is unlikely to be related to GORD.Introduction

• Hepatosplenomegaly.

• Seizures. 
• Genetic disorders (e.g., Trisomy 21). 
• Other chronic disorders (e.g., HIV). 
• Nonspecific symptoms 
• Fever. 
• Lethargy. 
• Failure to thrive. 
• Indication for further investigations:   
• If its information is helpful to define difficult or unusual cases. 
• If of value in making treatment decisions. 
• When secondary causes of GORD need to be excluded especially in severely affected patients.  
• Oesophageal pH metry  
• The severity of pathologic acid reflux does not correlate consistently with symptom severity or 
demonstrable complications. 
• To correlate persistent troublesome symptoms (e.g., cough, chest pain) with acid reflux episodes. 
• For evaluation of the efficacy of acid suppression therapy. 
• Clinical utility of pH monitoring for the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal 
complications of GOR is limited. 
• Multichannel intraluminal oesophageal pH impedance study (MII) 
• It is becoming the cornerstone of assessment of GOR.
• More sensitive tool compared to pH metry as it detects both acid and non-acid reflux.
• MII can also differentiate among liquid, gas or solid reflux.
• Indications for MII:
• To correlate persistent troublesome symptoms with both acid and nonacid reflux and to select 
those infants and children with extraoesophageal symptoms in whom GOR is an aggravating factor. 
• Clarify the role of acid and non-acid reflux in the aetiology of oesophagitis and other signs and 
symptoms suggestive for GORD.
• For evaluation of the efficacy of acid suppression therapy.
• To differentiate different entities like non erosive gastroesophageal relux disease (NORD), 
hypersensitive oesophagus and functional heartburn in patients with normal endoscopy.
• However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MII as a single technique for the diagnosis 
of GORD in infants and children.
• Barium Contrast Radiography  
• Not useful for the diagnosis of GORD as it has poor sensitivity and specificity but is useful to confirm 
or rule out anatomic abnormalities of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. 
• Nuclear Scintigraphy    
• Not recommended for the routine evaluation of GORD in children.
• May have a role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspiration in patients with chronic and refractory 
respiratory symptoms. A negative test does not rule out possible pulmonary aspiration of refluxed 
material. 
• May be helpful in assessing other factors that may aggravate GORD such as delayed gastric 
emptying.GORD is often diagnosed clinically and does not require investigations.Investigations

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 13       GASTROENTEROLOGY• Oesophageal manometry   
• Not sufficiently sensitive or specific to diagnose GORD. 
• Useful in suspected motility disorder e.g. achalasia or other motor disorders of the oesophagus that 
may mimic GORD.  
• Endoscopy and Biopsy 
• Not for diagnosis of GORD.
• To assess severity of GORD like evidence and extent of reflux oesophagitis. 
• To identify or rule out other causes of oesophagitis including eosinophilic oesophagitis which do not 
respond to conventional anti reflux therapy. 
• To diagnose and monitor other GORD complications like oesophageal stricture and Barrett’s 
oesophagus. 
• Empiric Trial of Acid Suppression as a Diagnostic Test  
• Expert opinion suggests that in an older child or adolescent with typical symptoms of GORD, an 
empiric trial of 2-4 weeks of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is justified. 
• However, improvement of heartburn, following treatment, does not confirm a diagnosis of GORD 
because symptoms may improve spontaneously or respond by a placebo effect. 
• No evidence to support an empiric trial of acid suppression as a diagnostic test in infants/young 
children where symptoms of GORD are less specific. 
• Trial of acid suppression should not be used as a diagnostic test for GORD in patients presenting 
with extraesophageal symptoms 
• Exposing them to the potential adverse events of PPI is not the best practice. Look for causes other 
than GORD before making such a move. 
• Physiologic GOR does not need medical treatment. 
• Symptoms are often nonspecific especially during infancy; many are exposed to anti-reflux treatment 
without any sufficient evidence. 
• Should always be balance between intended improvement of symptoms with risk of side-effects. 
• Parental education, reassurance & observe. 
• Lifestyle changes – avoid smoking including passive smoking. 
• Dietary management 
• Avoid overfeeding or overeating. 
• To modify feeding volumes and frequency according to age and weight. 
• Use of a thickened formula (or commercial anti regurgitation formulae) may decrease visible 
regurgitation but does not reduce in the frequency of oesophageal reflux episodes. Treatment
Suggested Schematic Therapeutic Approach 
• There may be association between cow’s milk protein allergy and GORD. 
• Therefore, infants with GORD that are refractory to conventional anti reflux therapy may benefit 
from a 2 weeks trial of elimination of cow’s milk in diet with an extensively hydrolyzed protein 
formula that has been evaluated in controlled trials. 
• Usually there may be other atopic symptoms or family history of atopy in these patients.  
• No evidence to support the routine elimination of any specific food in older children with GORD.

Section 13       GASTROENTEROLOGY• Position during sleep  
• Prone positioning decreases the amount of acid oesophageal exposure measured by pH probe 
compared with that measured in the supine position. 
• However, prone and lateral positions are associated with an increased incidence of sudden 
unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). 
• Therefore, in most infants from birth to 12months of age, supine positioning during sleep is 
recommended. 
• Prone or left lateral sleeping position and/or elevation of the head of the bed for adolescents with 
GORD may be of benefit. 
• Prokinetics   
• Treat pathophysiologic mechanism of GORD. 
• However, there is insufficient evidence of clinical efficacy to justify the routine use of 
metoclopramide, erythromycin, or domperidone for GORD.
• Baclofen may be useful in those children in whom other pharmacological treatments have failed. 
Beware of its side effects. 
• Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) (drug of choice in severe GORD).    
• Histamine-2 receptor antagonists are less effective than PPI. 
• Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonists (H2RAs). 
• Exhibit tachyphylaxis or tolerance (but PPIs do not) 
• Useful for on-demand treatment 
• Proton Pump Inhibitors 
• Administration of long-term acid suppression without a diagnosis is inadvisable.
• When acid suppression is required, the smallest effective dose should be used.
• Most patients require only once-daily PPI; routine use of twice-daily dose is not indicated. 
• The potential adverse effects of acid suppression, including increased risk of community-
acquired pneumonias and GI infections, need to be balanced against the benefits of therapy. 
• Antireflux surgery (either open or laparoscopic surgery) including fundoplication. 
• May be of benefit in selected children with chronic-relapsing GORD. 
• Indications include:    
• failure of optimal medical therapy, dependence on long-term medical therapy, 
• significant non-adherence with medical therapy, or 
• life threatening complications eg: pulmonary aspiration of refluxate.  
• Please take note children with underlying disorders predisposing to the most severe GORD e.g. 
neurological impairment are also at the highest risk for operative morbidity and postoperative failure. 
• It is essential therefore to rule out all non-GORD causes of the child’s symptoms, confirm the diagnosis 
of chronic relapsing GORD, discuss with the parents the pros and cons of surgery and to assure that the 
caregivers understand the potential complications, symptom recurrence and sometimes the need to be 
back on medical therapy.• Buffering agents (some efficacy in moderate GORD, relatively safe).   
• Antacids only in older children. 
• Buffering agents e.g. alginate are useful on demand  
• Chronic use of buffering agent is not recommended for GORD because some have absorbable 
components that may have adverse effects with long-term use.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 13       GASTROENTEROLOGY• Initial resuscitation, correct any fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycaemia and prevent 
hypothermia.
• Identify and treat the underlying cause. Specialist referral if necessary.
• Nutritional assessment and rehabilitation.
• Evaluation of stool output with no feeding for at least 24 hours. If diarrhea stop indicate osmotic 
diarrhea (diet-induced).
• In cases of lactose intolerance, breastfeeding should be continued unless there are persistent symptoms 
with perianal excoriation and failure of adequate weight gain. Formula-fed infants should be placed on 
lactose-free formula for 3-4 weeks.
• Consider treatment with protein hydrolysate in post-enteritis syndrome. 
• Suspect monosaccharide intolerance if diarrhoea continues even with lactose-free formula or with 
glucose-containing oral rehydration solution. Treatment includes bowel rest, parenteral nutrition and 
gradual introduction of feed. 
• Initiate cautious feeding once the child is stabilized 
• Some suggested plans for initial feeding are:
 √Frequent (every 2–3 h) oral small feeds 
 √Consider nasogastric feeding if the child is eating ≤ 80% of the amount 
 √Start at 25-50kcal/kg/day then slowly step up to 100-130 kcal/kg/day or more
 √Protein: 1–1.5 g/kg/day and gradually step up.
 √Total fluid should base on non-oedematous weight 
• Beware of refeeding syndrome in those with severe weight loss and those with prolonged IV hydration.
• Serial monitoring and necessary correction of serum electrolytes is required in the early stage of 
nutritional recovery.
• Phosphate supplementation is usually recommended. ( Refer Ch 80:  Approach to Severely Malnourished 
Children )
• Consider micronutrient supplementations in children with chronic diarrhoea and malnourishment, e.g. 
vitamin A, zinc, thiamine, iron, folate etc.Management of chronic diarrhoea

Functional Constipation (FC) in Children 
Organic Causes of Constipation9• Definition:  constipation in the absence of underlying organic disease7. 
• It is the cause of childhood constipation in 95% of cases7
• Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination.
• Diagnostic criteria based on ROME IV  1,2,3:
Must include 1 month of at least 2  of the following in infants up to 4 years of age, children and 
adolescent:
1.  2 or fewer defecation per week
2.  History of excessive stool retention
3.  History of painful or hard bowel movements
4.  History of large diameter stools 
5.  Presence of a large faecal mass in the rectum
In toilet trained children, the following additional criteria may be used
6.  At least 1 episode/ week of incontinence after the acquisition of toileting skills
7.  History of large diameter stools which may obstruct the toilet
*After appropriate evaluation, the symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition.

5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 13       GASTROENTEROLOGYPhysiology of Normal Defaecation7
• Delay in passage of meconium (possibility of Hirschsprung disease)
• Age at onset of symptoms and the initial triggering event: typically 2-4 years old for functional 
constipation, around the age of toilet training
• Consistency/nature of stool: infrequent, very large stool (large enough to block the toilet) is common 
chronic FC.
• Painful or bloody stools: differential diagnosis includes anal fissure, perianal group A streptococcal 
infection, etc.
• Abdominal pain: a very common symptom in children for many organic and functional disorders. Many 
constipated child may have Recurrent Abdominal Pain (RAP), which may be relieved by the periodic 
passage of large stool.
• Stool withholding behaviour: voluntary stool withholding may manifest as unusual behaviour, which 
may be mistaken for straining.
• Soiling: occurs as a result of involuntary passage of liquid stool around faecal impaction in the rectum. It 
is almost always associated with psychological distress in the child/family.Potential Alarm Features In Constipation2
Clinical Assessment7:
Key features in the historyThe physiology of normal defaecation depends on the interplay of multiple factors:
• Stool is moved through the distal colon by peristaltic contractions of the bowel wall.
• This movement is influenced by colonic tone, which in turn is influenced by diurnal variation and the 
gastro-colonic reflex (altered colonic tone in response to a meal).
• Once the stool enters the recto-sigmoid junction, distension of the rectal wall results in reflex rectal 
contraction with concomitant relaxation of the internal anal sphincter.
• Stool is therefore presented to the anal canal and enters the “firing position”.
• Stool is perceived in the anal canal, and a decision to expel or withhold the faeces is made.
• Interruptions at any stage during this process may lead to constipation.
• The commonest interruption is a painful stimulus perceived during defecation at around the time of 
toilet training (e.g. anal fissure), change of diet or infections9. Other interruption for older child includes 
acute events such moving house, starting nursery/school, fears and phobias, major change in family, 
taking medicines4.
• Once the painful stimulus has occurred, the child may learn that voluntary withholding of stool prevents 
recurrence of the painful stimulus. 
• This may lead to a vicious cycle of stool- withholding →faecal impaction → further stool- withholding→ 
further faecal impaction →overflow faecal incontinence. 
• Prolonged faecal impaction can lead to chronic rectal distension and eventual loss of normal rectal 
sensation. 
• This can lead to further impaction of stool and megarectum.
• Passage of meconium >48 h in a term newborn
• Constipation starting in the first month of life
• Family history of Hirschsprung’s disease
• Blood in the stools in the absence of anal fissures
• Failure to thrive
• Bilious vomiting
=== PAGE 473 ===

456 457
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 13       GASTROENTEROLOGY• General health, nutritional status and growth.
• Abdominal palpation:  this reveal a faecal mass in at least half of all chronically constipated children. 
The size of the mass reflects the extent of rectal/colonic involvement. 
• Perianal inspection: to look for signs of soiling, inflammation, anal fissure or congenital abnormalities 
such as anterior anus.
• Rectal examination:  unlikely to add further useful information if clinical features are typical of 
functional chronic constipation. However, if clinical features are suggestive of underlying organic 
pathology (e.g. Hirschsprung disease, anal stenosis particularly in infancy), a single rectal examination is 
indicated to assess tone, calibre, position and the presence of stool in the rectum.
• Neurological assessment:  inspection of the lumbar-sacral spine and examination of the lower limbs is 
essential.
• Investigations are generally NOT indicated if the history and examination are typical of FC.
• The following investigation can be considered but should NOT be routine:
 √Abdominal radiograph:  
Useful to demonstrate spinal abnormalities and to delineate extend of faecal loading (when 
abdominal examination is not conclusive). Should NOT be routine due to high radiation dose.
 √Bowel transit studies: 
To assess segmental colonic transit time by measuring the position of swallowed radio-opaque 
markers on plain abdominal radiographs. This is done at centre with gastroenterology services.
 √Anorectal manometry:  
To assess the normal relaxation of the internal anal sphincter in response to rectal distention. This 
test is invasive, not readily available in most centres.
 √Full thickness rectal biopsy:  
Diagnostic of Hirschsprung disease and indicated only if there is strong clinical suspicion.
 √Electrolytes, micronutrients, endocrine assessment: 
Iron deficiency is common in childhood constipation. Electrolytes (e.g. hypercalcemia) and 
endocrine abnormalities (e.g. hypothyroidism) should be considered if history and examination are 
suggestive.
 √Allergy:  
In children with atopic features and evidence of proctitis or perianal erythema, investigation for 
cow’s milk allergy/allergic colitis should be considered.Key points in examination
Investigation:• Diet: may have history of anorexia, poor energy intake and poor fluid intake. Low fibre intake is 
common. 
• Urinary symptoms: urinary tract infections, urinary frequency and nocturnal enuresis are common in 
chronically constipated children.
• Family history of constipation/irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

Section 13       GASTROENTEROLOGY1. Explanation of normal bowel function. 
Careful explanation of this process to the parents and child help the family understand the disorder and 
aids compliance with therapy. A basic understanding of the pathophysiology may also relieve tensions in 
family associated with blame and guilt.
2. Diet/fluids and exercise. 
A normal fibre diet is recommended, along with adequate fluid. Dietary fibre/bulking agents help 
retain water in the gut lumen by osmosis, and stimulate peristalsis by adding bulk to the stool. Regular 
exercise promotes intestinal peristalsis and helps with bowel transit.
3. Behavioural advice.  
Gaining a child trust is important. Time needs to be spent reassuring children about their condition 
and the treatment. The psychological principle of ignoring failure and rewarding success is important. 
Anything that helps relax the child will help with the defecation problem, whether it is fear of pain or 
persistent soiling. Conflict should be avoided.
4. Toilet training. 
Regular toileting is a crucial part of the management. Children need to be encouraged to sit on the 
toilet on waking, after all meals, and before bed. The peak stimulant effects is in the morning and after 
breakfast there will be an enhanced gastro-colonic reflex. It is important the child has a comfortable 
position, e.g. toilet seat with foot support. It must be stressed to the parents that this is the most 
important part of the child’s management. It is important that the child sits on the toilet for long 
enough.
5. Simple reward schemes. Reward schemes can be highly effective in the behavioural management. 
The star chart can be used but any attractive variations of this can be used to appeal to each particular 
child (e.g. sticker charts, computer game time). Rewards can be given for compliance at first (e.g. 
sitting on toilet twice a day after breakfast and tea), and later rewards are given for success (e.g. bowel 
openings into the toilet).
1. Stool disimpaction in the presence of faecal impaction/megarectum1,2,3,4,6,7. Can be done outpatient or 
inpatient, via oral or per rectal routes.
Disimpaction is important to facilitate normal defecation dynamics and then give a sufficiently high 
laxative dose to ensure regular emptying7.
Increased soiling is often seen during the early phase of disimpaction66,7.
Review children undergoing outpatient disimpaction within 1 week3.Management:

Prolonged Jaundice and Neonatal Cholestasis 
• Prolonged jaundice is defined as visible jaundice that persists beyond 14 days in a term baby and 21 
days in a preterm baby. 
• Most neonatal jaundice is usually self-limited and resolved within 7-10 days postnatally.
• Infants who develop recurrence or new onset of jaundice warrant further investigations and treatment.
• To identify overt pathological causes (clinical assessment – sepsis, haemolysis, inborn errors of 
metabolism (IEM), endocrine disorders)
• For identification of occult infection – e.g., urinary tract infection
• To exclude neonatal cholestasis
• Risk of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) – e.g. Crigler Najjar syndrome
The aetiology of jaundice is classified into unconjugated (table 1) or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 
In babies with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is defined as a serum c onjugated bilirubin 
concentration greater than 25 micromol/l or greater than 20 percent of total bilirubin , a prompt referral 
to Pediatrics unit is needed to delineate the cause. 
(Conjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is discussed under the heading of Neonatal Cholestasis)
Inadequate breastfeeding 
– inadequate nutrition 
and dehydrationLactational failure:
Risk of hypovolemia and hypernatremia
Jaundice due to slower bilirubin elimination and increases enterohepatic 
circulation of bilirubin.
Address maternal breastfeeding complications:
breast engorgement, cracked nipples, maternal fatigue, and stress. Late 
premature and small gestational age - ineffective suck due to immature oro-
buccal coordination and swallowing mechanism.
Breast milk jaundice The commonest cause of persistent benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
Typically presented after 5 days of life, peaks within 2 weeks after birth and 
progressively declines to normal levels over 3-12 weeks
The level should be monitored - remains unconjugated and the level does 
not increase. 
Cause by hydrolysis of beta -D- glucuronic acid by Beta-glucosidase from 
breast milk led to increase in intestinal absorption of unconjugated bilirubin
Polymorphic mutation of the UGT1A1 gene (UGTA1*6 genotype). Continuing 
breastfeeding is recommended. 
Infection (e.g. urinary 
tract infection (UTI))Increased in oxidative stress to neonatal red blood cells, hypovolemia due to 
poor feeding

Section 13       GASTROENTEROLOGY
Unlike unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal cholestasis is ALWAYS pathological.
Can be classified into biliary causes (obstructive, large extrahepatic, or small intrahepatic bile ducts) or 
hepatocellular causes (defect in membrane transport, embryogenesis, metabolic dysfunction etc.).
Cholestatic jaundice must be considered in jaundiced babies presenting with acholic stools and dark urine. Adapted from Paediatric Protocols For Malaysian Hospitals, 4th Edition (2018), Malaysian Paediatric 
Association for Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia. 
Neonatal Cholestasis (NC)
Evaluation of NC should be taken in a staged approach guided by a focused and detail history, 
physical examination and supported by targeted laboratory and radio-imaging studies.  
Identifying one possible cause does not exclude co-existent pathology. E.g., it is entirely possible to 
have both CMV and biliary atresia as dual pathologies.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 13       GASTROENTEROLOGYBiliary atresia Commonest:
•  form of chronic obstructive cholestasis in infancy
•  indication for liver transplant in children 
Affects 1 in 8000-12000 live births worldwide (around 1:10000 in Malaysia).
A fibro-Inflammatory disease of the biliary tree occurs perinatally (acquired) 
or congenital (embryogenic).  Classified according to the morphological 
abnormalities (Type I, IIa, IIb and III). It can be syndromic and associated with 
splenic malformation (biliary atresia splenic malformation, BASM).
Well-appearing infant – acholic stool and dark urine
Early treatment (Kasai’s portoenterostomy) in the first 45-60 days of life 
improves transplant-free survival up to 75-90% 
Nutrition is of upmost important: fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, 
medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-rich formula.
Choledochal cyst Although there are some distinctions between ultrasound findings of BA 
and choledochal cyst (dilated or cystic duct, no atretic gall bladder), careful 
evaluation for BA should still be carried out due to resemblance of US finding 
(e.g.  BA Type 1) and possible dual pathologies.
Infection: Congenital 
CMVMost common congenital infection. Most newborns affected are 
asymptomatic, but some may present with low birth weight, microcephaly, 
chorioretinitis, deafness and periventricular calcifications. Hallmark of liver 
related problems are hepatosplenomegaly and cholestasis. 
Endocrine Hypothyroidism – mothers with thyroid condition
High TSH, low FT4
Panhypopituitarism: Cholestasis, hypoglycemia, shock due to adrenal 
insufficiency. Micropenis in boys. Some infants have associated septo-optic 
dysplasia in which MRI brain is required. Cholestasis resolves with hormonal 
replacement.
Alagille syndrome Autosomal dominant, most common familial intrahepatic cholestasis. 
Confirmed by JAG1 and NOTCH2 genes mutations. Clinical features: Alagille 
facies, posterior embryotoxon, butterfly vertebrae, renal disease, cardiac 
defects. Liver pathology – Paucity of interlobular ducts leading to cholestasis 
with occasional acholic stool, elevated GGT and transaminases. 
Citrin deficiency An important treatable cause of neonatal hepatitis among Asians.
Investigations MAY yield elevated total blood galactose but normal galactose-1-
uridyl transferase (GALT) (i.e. secondary Galactosemia).
Elevated citrulline in plasma amino acids and dried blood spot amino acids .     
Treatable with galactose free formula (if there is secondary galactosaemia) with 
medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementationSalient features of certain causes in well appearing infants

 ͳProvide adequate calories to support growth
 ͳMay consider high carbohydrate, normal protein, and medium chain triglycerides (MCT)-based diet 
(Caloric 125% of RDA, protein 2-3gm/kg/day)
 ͳMicronutrient supplementation, especially fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamin A, D, E, K) e.g., Appeton infant 
drop
 ͳSometimes, a referral to a dietitian is necessary 
 ͳConsider enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition in infants with inadequate intake or increased 
metabolic demand
 ͳSpecial diet consideration in certain metabolic diseases
Examples:
Infection – broad-spectrum antibiotics, +/- antiviral (acyclovir)
Inspissated bile syndrome - Ursodeoxycholic acid (10-20mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses)
Galactosemia – Galactose- free diet (soy-based formula)
HT1 -  NTBC 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione).
PN-associated cholestasis – provide balanced nutrition, wean off PN or modify PN esp. lipid content; and 
ursodeoxycholic acid
Hypothyroidism – Oral L- thyroxineSpecific therapies may be directed at any identifiable underlying cause. Most idiopathic neonatal hepatitis 
have spontaneous resolution. ** remember to supplement intravenous hydration with dextrose when the babies are fasting for the 
imaging study due to the risk of hypoglycemia, especially in high-risk babies suspected of, e.g., IEM, hepatic 
dysfunction, etc.
Liver biopsy:  Percutaneous liver biopsy for histopathology examination. It may be helpful in diagnosing 
certain diseases, assessing condition severity and provide prognosis. 
Sometimes referral to other specialties are necessary, eg: ophthalmology to look for cataract, posterior 
embryotoxon, chorioretinitis, cherry red spots, optic nerve hypoplasia & hearing assessment for congenital 
CMV infection.
Paediatric surgical consult (esp pale stool and dark urine, anatomical anomalies from ultrasound abdomen)

Evaluation and Management of Children With Liver Disease 
Paediatric acute liver failure is a complex, rapidly progressive clinical syndrome with significant morbidity 
and mortality. A timely, age-based diagnostic approach could establish an etiology and treatment decisions. 
The interval between clinical presentation and clinical outcome, spontaneous recovery, orthotopic liver 
transplant (OLT), or death can be as early as hours to days.
Acute deterioration of the liver functions because of a precipitating factor in the background of chronic 
liver disease (Wilson disease, autoimmune hepatitis, cryptogenic, Budd chiari syndrome, IEM, etc.). To 
date, there is no universal definition describing ACLF in children. Clinical manifestations include jaundice, 
coagulopathy, ascites, and/or encephalopathy. Common precipitating triggers are bacterial infection, sepsis, 
viral (HAV, HEV), and drugs. ACLF carries high 28 days mortality, and there is no proven treatment other 
than OLT. i. Acute onset of liver disease without evidence of chronic liver disease (within 8 weeks of onset)
ii. Biochemical evidence of severe liver injury (Hepatocellular injury and biliary dysfunction)
 ͳCoagulopathy not corrected by vitamin K
 ͳProthrombin time (PT) > 15 seconds or INR > 1.5 with evidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) or 
PT > 20s or INR > 2 with or without encephalopathy
The criteria for Neonatal acute liver failure is the same as PALF definition except that the INR is reset at > 3.0 
(Normal newborn INR may extend up to 2.0, and premature newborns may have an INR >2.0)Paediatric Acute Liver Failure

• Early referral to intensive care unit with paediatric intensivist if patient condition worsens or 
progress to liver failure
• Closely monitored in quiet darkened room with head end elevated at 30° and head in neutral 
position (to decrease intracerebral pressure and minimize cerebral irritability) 
• Place pads on bed rails to prevent injury from aggressive, combative and forceful movements
• DO NOT sedate unless already ventilated because it may precipitate respiratory failure and 
death 
• Maintain oxygenation 
• Frequent neurological observations (1-4hourly) 
• Give Vitamin K (IV or Subcutaneous) to correct prolong PT. To correct prolong INR in the event 
of bleeding or optimization for invasive procedures. Despite abnormal INR, most of the patients 
with PALF maintain normal hemostasis and therefore bleeding often precipitated by low 
platelets counts and sepsis. Platelet count should be maintained ≥ 50 x109 /dl. 
• Overzealous blood product transfusion may cause transfusion-related lung injury and fluid 
overload.
• If frank bleeding (GIT / Oral) occurs, consider prudent use of FFP 10ml/kg and cryoprecipitate 
5ml/kg. 
• Prophylactic H2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor or oral antacid to prevent gastric/duodenal 
ulceration 
• Full septic screen(excluding Lumbar Puncture), CXR should be obtained. Treat sepsis 
aggressively with broad spectrum antibiotics (aerobic and anaerobic cover, monitoring level of

Aim to maintain hydration & renal function while reducing the risk of cerebral oedema. 
• Maintain euvolemia; consider 80% of normal maintenance if condition progressed further.
• Maintenance fluids consist of Dextrose 10% in 0.45% or 0.90% Normal saline. Maintain glucose 
levels between 4-8 mmol/l.
• A central vein catheterization is necessary for high glucose concentration delivery. 
• Check capillary blood sugar every 2-4 hourly (maintain ≥ 4mmol/l). 
• Strict monitoring of urine output & fluid balance (catheterization if necessary). 
• Aim urine output > 1ml/kg/hour. A reduction in urine output  (<1ml/kg/hour) may indicate AKI 
and continuous filtration should be considered to prevent acidosis and volume overload.
• Consider checking urinary electrolytes; serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and osmolarity. 
• Maintain sodium requirements 2-3 mmol/kg/day. Treat hyponatremia when Na < 120 mmol/l or 
symptomatic.
• Renal dysfunction - Possible causes: hepatorenal syndrome, dehydration, low CVP , low cardiac 
output, nephrotoxic medication exposure (e.g. NSAIDs). Consider haemofiltration or dialysis 
(discuss with nephrologist/intensivist) 
• In the presence of persistent hypotension (decreased SVR) – might consider IV noradrenaline 
infusion followed by vasopressin analogues. May consider IV hydrocortisone in cases suspected 
of adrenal insufficiency. 
• Ammonia lowering measures – protein restriction, bowel decontamination with lactulose
• Provide adequate energy intake to avoid catabolism. Enteral feeding is preferred over total 
parenteral nutrition (with lipids). * lipids are avoided in mitochondrial disease and fatty acid 
oxidation defects. 
• If the patient progresses to HE, consider stopping oral protein. Gradually reintroduce at 0.5-1g/
kg/day, then 1-2g/kg/day either enterally or parenterally.
• Maintain normal Na, K, Mg, Phosphate and calcium.
• Bowel decontamination : Lactulose (1-2ml/kg every 4-6hourly) to produce 3-4 loose stools per 
day. Consider Rifaximin or neomycin if available.
• Low copper diet for suspected Wilson disease
• Try to avoid any nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic agents
• IV N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is indicated if paracetamol poisoning in paediatrics ( history and high 
index of suspicion are very important as most of the time blood paracetamol levels are already 
normal by the time the patient presents to hospital with liver failure).  NAC did not improve 
1-year survival in non-paracetamol PALF. 1-year liver transplant free survival was significantly 
lower with NAC, particularly among those < 2 years old. (Squires RH, Dhawan A, Alonso E, et al. 
Hepatology 2013 April; 57(4):1542–1549.) 
• Antibiotics: Combination that provides a good cover against gram-negative organisms and 
anaerobes e.g. cefotaxime and metronidazole if no specific infective agent is suspected (e.g. 
Leptospira. Mycoplasma). 
• Antiviral: Acyclovir is recommended in neonates and small infants with ALF due to the possibility 
of HSV infection.
• Antifungal if clinically suspected.
• Suspected autoimmune/immune-mediated – corticosteroids, other immunomodulating 
therapies
• Suspected Wilson disease – zinc gluconate, trientine
• Amanita phalloides poisoning – iv benzylpenicillin (high dose)

• In the presence of sudden coma, consider intracranial bleed: request a CT brain. 
• Patients with Grade 3 or 4 Encephalopathy require mechanical ventilation to maintain normal 
cerebral perfusion pressure. Sedation may use a combination of opioid (morphine or fentanyl) 
and benzodiazepines (midazolam). 
• Try to avoid peak end-expiratory pressure of >8cm H 2O (may increase ICP); PaCO 2 should be 
kept within 4-4.5 kPa.(30-35mmHg). Extended hypocapnia may risk patient of hypoxia.
• Raised Intracranial pressure : consider mannitol (rapid bolus 0.5g/kg as a 20% solution over 15 
minutes; can be repeated if serum osmolality is < 320 mOsm/l), or induction of hypernatremia 
using hypertonic saline (Na > 145mmol/L) and mild cerebral hypothermia (32-35’C) in refractory 
high ICP .
• Inotropic support could be used to increase mean arterial blood pressure for optimal cerebral 
perfusion pressure.
• Act as a bridge to liver transplant (discuss with Paediatrics intensivist and /or nephrologist)
• Removing toxins and inflammatory mediators which could lead to multiorgan failure
• May consider total plasma exchange or continuous venovenohemofiltration (CVVHDF) 
• Only definitive treatment that improves survival in PALF

Maximum INR reached during the illness is the most sensitive predictor of outcome. INR > 4 is associated 
with the poorer outcome without OLT, whereas for paracetamol overdose, metabolic acidosis (pH <7.3) 
after the second day of overdose and adequately hydrated is associated with high mortality.
Patients with chronic liver disease may progress to end-stage liver disease in childhood or adolescents, 
depending on the natural progression of the disease and its aetiology. Sometimes, patients may present 
with complications on initial medical attention with unsuspected chronic liver disease or incidental findings

Decision making after acute resuscitation
Reassessment of patients
When patient’s condition is stable and resuscitative measures have been instituted,
Assess patient for cause of bleeding and the need for surgery/endoscopy.
History is reviewed.
Ask for history of chronic liver disease, dyspepsia/abdominal pain, chronic or intermittent gastrointestinal 
bleeding (e.g. polyps), drug ingestion (anticoagulants, aspirin), or acute fever (dengue haemorrhagic 
fever), easy bleeding tendencies, diarrhoea, constipation, haematological disorders, antibiotics treatment 
(pseudomembranous colitis).
Physical examination  should be directed towards looking for signs of chronic liver disease (spider 
angiomata, palmar erythema, portal hypertension or splenomegaly) or telengiectasia / angiomata / 
purpura / pigmentation in mouth, trunk and extremities, etc.
perianal exam – fissures, fistula etc.One of the most helpful factors in narrowing the cause of GI bleeding is the patient’s age:

Section 13       GASTROENTEROLOGYDiagnostic measures to localise source of bleeding
• Oesophagogastro-duodenoscopy (OGDS) or colonoscopy can be
• performed when patient’s condition is stable.
• Double contrast barium study less useful than endoscopy but may be indicated in patients when 
endoscopy cannot precisely locate the source of bleeding (e.g. in intussusception).
• Ultrasound abdomen should be requested if there is evidence of liver disease, splenomegaly or 
intussusception is suspected.
• Nuclear scintigraphy eg Meckel’s scan can be useful in detecting Meckel’s diverticulum
• Visceral angiography can precisely locate the source of bleeding. But is only reserved for patients 
with a difficult bleeding problem.
Definitive measures to management of gastrointestinal bleeding
Surgical Cause
When surgical cause is suspected, early referral to the surgeon is important so that a team approach to 
the problem can be adopted.
• Intussusception requires immediate surgical referral and intervention may be attempted by the 
radiologist and proceed with surgical intervention if failed radiological reduction.
• Meckel’s diverticulum (painless PR bleed)
• Malrotation with volvulus (urgent referral to avoid further ischaemia to bowel)Medical Cause
Bleeding peptic ulcer
• Start H2 receptor antagonist (e.g. cimetidine).
• Proton pump inhibitor (eg: omeprazole) can be considered as it has higher acid suppressant activity.
• If biopsy shows presence of Helicobacter pylori infection, treat accordingly.
• Stop all incriminating drugs e.g. aspirin, steroids and anticoagulant drugs if possible.
Bleeding oesophageal varices or ulcer
• Do not transfuse blood too rapidly as this will lead to increase in Central Venous Pressure (CVP) and a 
rapid increase in portal pressure may precipitate further bleeding.
• Aim to maintain Hb around 9 g/dL.
• Refer Paediatric Surgeon and Paediatric Gastroenterologist to consider use of octreotide.
• If bleeding continues and the patient is not responsive to all of the above management, consider 
placing a Sengstaken-Blackmore Tube. This however is RARELY needed, and it is performed under 
emergency circumstances. Patient must be intubated and transferred to intensive care setting prior 
to Sengstaken Blackmore insertion. 
• Sengstaken Blackmore tube size depends on the child’s weight
10-30 kg    paediatric size 14F
> 30 kg      paediatric size 16F
• For infants < 10kg in whom use of a Sengstaken tube is not possible because of size,  a Foley catheter 
inserted orally may be effective.
Pseudomembranous colitis
• Stop all antibiotics – usually this measure will heal most mild pseudomembranous colitis.
• Consider oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin in moderate to severe pseudomembranous colitis
Bleeding in neonates
• Rule out swallowed maternal blood esp at birth
• Consider to give IV vitamin K 0.3mg/kg even coagulation results are pending. 
Bleeding in a child with suspected liver disease
• Consider to give IV vitamin K 0.3mg/kg (max 10mg)
• Think of variceal bleed if there are signs of portal hypertension

Paediatric HIV
• Babies of HIV positive mothers.
• Abandoned babies / street children.
• Babies of mothers with high risk behaviour (e.g. drug addicts, commercial sex workers, multiple sex 
partners / single-teenage or underage).
• Sexually abused children and children with sexually transmitted disease.
• Children receiving regular blood transfusions or blood products
e.g. Thalassaemics.
• Vertical transmission of HIV may occur while in utero, during the birth process or through breast-
feeding. The rates vary from 25 - 30%.
• Breastfeeding confers an additional 14% risk of transmission, and is therefore generally contraindicated.
• Blood and blood products should be used judiciously even though the risk of transmission of HIV 
infection from blood transfusion is very small.• Standard precautions must be observed at all times. It is vital to use protective barriers such as gloves, 
mask, goggles and gown with waterproof sleeves. Boots are to be used for institutional deliveries.
• All equipment, including resuscitation equipment should be cleaned and sterilised.
• For home deliveries, battery operated suction device should be used.
• Standard precautions are to be observed in caring for the babies.
• For parents or relatives, gloves are given for use when handling the placenta after discharge, or during 
burial of stillbirth or dead babies at home.
The placenta from HIV positive mothers should be soaked in formalin solution before disposal. 
Alternatively, the placenta can be sealed in a plastic bag or other leak-proof container with clear 
instructions to parents not to remove it from the container.
• Vaccines protect HIV-infected children from getting severe vaccine-preventable diseases, and are 
generally well tolerated.
• All routine vaccinations can be given according to schedule, with special precautions for live vaccines 
i.e. BCG and MMR:
• BCG : safe if child is asymptomatic and not immunosuppressed (e.g. at birth); omit if symptomatic 
or immunosuppressed.
• MMR : safe, omit in children with severe immunosuppression (CD4<15%)
• Other recommended vaccines:
• Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
• Varicella-zoster vaccine, where available. 2 doses with 2 months interval. Omit in those with severe 
immunosuppression (CD4 < 15%).
Despite vaccination, remember that long term protection may not be achieved in severe immune 
suppression i.e. they may still be at risk of acquiring the infections!Deliveries and infant nursing

• Transmission rate (without intervention) : 25 to 30%.
• ARV prophylaxis +/- elective LSCS reduces transmission to < 2%
• Feeding baby with infant formula as breast feeding doubles the risk of transmission. In situation where 
a mother insists to breastfeed, refer to specialist and take risk-reduction measures to reduce the risk of 
HIV transmission.
• Difficulty in making early diagnosis because of presence of maternal antibody in babies. Stress 
importance of regular blood tests and follow-up.
• Admit to ward or early review by paediatric team (if not admitted).
• Examine baby for:
• Evidence of other congenital infections.
• Symptoms of drug withdrawal (reviewing maternal history is helpful).
• Most babies are asymptomatic and only require routine perinatal care.
• Start on prophylaxis ARV as soon as possible.
• Sample blood for:
• HIV DNA/RNA PCR (done in IMR, do not use cord blood; sensitivity 90% by 1 month age).
• FBC
• Other tests as indicated: LFT, RFT, HbsAg, Hepatitis C, CMV, syphilis serology.• Total substitution of breastfeeding with infant formula.
• Elective Caesarean section.
• Antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis.
Children born to HIV positive mothers are usually asymptomatic at birth. However, all will have acquired 
maternal antibodies. In uninfected children, antibody testing becomes negative by 10-18 months of age.
During pregnancy
Counsel mother regarding:
Neonatal PeriodSeveral interventions have proven effective in reducing vertical transmission:
Management of Babies Born to HIV Infected MothersFactors associated with higher transmission rate
Maternal
• Low CD 4 counts
• High viral load
• Advanced disease
• Seroconversion during pregnancy
Foetal
• Premature delivery of the baby
• Delivery and procedures
• Invasive procedures such as episiotomy
• Foetal scalp electrodes
• Foetal blood sampling and amniocentesis
• Vaginal delivery
• Rupture of membranes > 4 hours
• Chorioamnionitis

1. Low risk - Infant of HIV–infected pregnant mother who is on ART and has sustained viral suppression
High risk - Infant at higher risk of HIV acquisition e.g. infant born to HIV-infected mother who:
 ͳHas not received intrapartum/antepartum ARV
 ͳHas received only intrapartum ARV
 ͳHas received antepartum ARV but does not have viral suppression near delivery
2. Dual ARV regimen (Zidovudine + Nevirapine) may be considered in circumstances where mum has low 
viraemia (VL <400 copies/ml)
3. ARV should be served as soon as possible (preferably within 6-12 hours of life) and certainly no later 
than 48 hours.
4. Dose of Sy ZDV for premature baby
< 30 weeks: 2mg/kg 12 hourly from birth to 4 weeks, then 3mg/kg 12hourly age 4-6 weeks
>30 weeks: 2mg/kg 12hourly from birth to 2 wks, then 3mg/kg 12hourly age 2-6 wks.
5. If oral feeding is contraindicated, then use IV ZDV at 1.5mg/kg/dose.
Clinical outcome following the introduction of ART in children is excellent, with reduced mortality and 
morbidity reported from various cohorts. However, this needs to be balanced with: the failure of current 
drugs to eradicate infection, long-term medication side effects and compliance-adherence issues.
• ART is now recommended to be started in all children and adolescents living with HIV. Early initiation 
of ART reduces mortality, improves neurodevelopmental, growth and pubertal outcomes, improves 
immune reconstitution and reduces inflammation.
• Rapid ART initiation (within 7 days) should be offered following HIV diagnosis and clinical assessment 
and when parents and child are ready to start.
• Provide adherence support and assessment before starting ART and at all subsequent visits. Stress that 
non-adherence to medications allows continuous viral replication and encourages the emergence of 
drug resistance and subsequent treatment failure.
• Please consult a specialist/consultant before starting treatment.Antiretroviral Therapy

Section 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASE• Treatment failure based on clinical, virologic and immunological parameters
e.g. deterioration of condition, unsuppressed / rebound viral load or dropping of CD4 count/%.
• Assess and review adherence.
• Perform genotypic resistant testing to help choose appropriate ARV.
• If genotypic resistant testing not available, preferable to change all ARV (or at least 2) to drugs that 
the patient had not been exposed to before
• Choices are very limited! Do not add a drug to a failing regime.
• Consider potential drug interactions with other medications.
• In a patient with advanced disease, the patient’s quality of life must be considered.
• Toxicity or intolerance of the current regimen
• Choose drugs with toxicity profiles different from the current regimen.
• Changing a single drug is permissible.
• Avoid reducing dose below lower end of therapeutic range for that drug.
• Treatment simplification/optimization
• In virologically suppressed children, may consider simplifying drug regimen to once daily low pill 
burden regimens with optimal toxicity profiles and efficacy data.
• Consult infectious diseases specialist before switching.
• The aim of ART is to achieve an undetectable VL (< 50copies/ml) and CD4 reconstitution.
• Follow up usually every 3 – 4 months. However, if just commencing/ switching ART, then every 2-4 
weeks.
• Ask about medication:
• Adherence (who, what, how and when of taking medications)
• Side effects e.g. vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice.
• Examine: Growth, head circumference, pallor, jaundice, oral thrush, lipodystrophy syndrome (especially 
if on PI).
• FBC, CD4 count, viral load 3-4 monthly, RFT, LFT, Ca/PO4 every 6 months; fasting lipid profiles, blood 
sugar and urinalysis yearly.
• CD4 count can be monitored less frequently (every 6–12 months) in children who are clinically stable, 
have good adherence, virologically suppressed and CD4 count values that are well above the threshold 
for opportunistic infection risk.
• Explore social, psychological and financial issues e.g. school, home environment etc. Many children 
are orphans, live with relatives, adopted or under NGO’s care. Referral to social welfare often required. 
Compliance- adherence to therapy strongly linked to these issues.
• HIV / AIDS is a notifiable disease. Notify health office within 1 week of diagnosis.
• Screen other family members for HIV.
• Refer parents to Physician Clinic if they have HIV and are not on follow up.
• Disclosure of diagnosis to the child (would-be teenager, issues on sexual rights)
• Be aware of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)
• In this condition there is a paradoxical worsening of a known condition (e.g. pulmonary TB or 
lymphadenitis) or the appearance of a new condition after initiating ARV.
• This is due to restored immunity to specific infectious or non-infectious antigens.
• Address adolescent’s issues
• Common issues include peer pressure, sexual health, pregnancy, substance use/abuse.
• Plan a transition program to adult care services.When to change?

Section 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASE• Despite sharing of household utensils, linen, clothes, personal hygiene products; and daily interactions 
e.g. biting, kissing and other close contact, repeated studies have failed to show transmission through 
contact with saliva, sweat, tears and urine (except with exposure to well defined body fluids i.e. blood, 
semen, vaginal fluids).
• It is important to stress that the following has not transmitted infection:
• Casual contact with an infected person
• Swimming pools
• Droplets coughed or sneezed into the air
• Toilet seats
• Sharing of utensils such as cups and plates
• Insects
Note: It is difficult to isolate the virus from urine and saliva of seropositive children. So, day care settings are 
not a risk. However, due to a theoretical risk of direct inoculation by biting, aggressive children should not be 
sent to day care. Teachers should be taught to handle cuts/grazes with care.
• Goal is to prevent HIV infection among those sustaining exposure, and provide information and support 
during the follow up interval until infection is diagnosed or excluded with certainty.
• Risk for occupational transmission of HIV to Health Care Workers (HCW).
• Risk for HIV transmission after a percutaneous exposure to HIV infected blood is 0.3%; risk after mucous 
membrane exposure is 0.1%.
• Risk is dependent on:
• Type, volume of body fluid involved
• Type of exposure that has occurred
• Viral load of the source patient
• Disease stage
• Wash wounds, skin exposure sites with soap, water; flush mucous membranes with water.
• Notify supervisor; refer HCW to designated doctor as in hospital sharp injury protocol.Horizontal Transmission Within Families

Tuberculosis
• Disease with the symptoms, signs and /or radiographic findings caused by MTB complex (including M. 
tuberculosis  and M. bovis ) infection.
• The disease may be pulmonary or extrapulmonary, (i.e., central nervous system (CNS), lymph nodes 
(LN), bone & joint etc) or disseminated (i.e., miliary or both pulmonary and extrapulmonary).
• Constitutional symptoms such as difficult feeding, anorexia, difficult/ poor weight gain, weight loss, 
lethargy/ less playful and fever should be present though non-specific
• Other symptoms are based on organs involved:
• Pulmonary:  chronic cough/ respiratory symptoms, wheezing in young infant, haemoptysis and pleuritic 
chest pain are more common in older child/ adolescent
• Lymph node:  gradually increase in size, matted and not responding to antibiotic, cold abscess, 
discharging sinus
• CNS:  irritability, lethargy, encephalopathy, seizure
• Spine/ Bone:  bone swelling +/- sinus, pathological fracture
Diagnosis in children is challenging as they have paucibacillary disease (smear negative) and symptoms 
mimic common childhood illnesses.
• Recent contact  with a person (usually adult) with active TB is a very useful tool in assisting the TB 
diagnosis in children
• Symptoms and signs suggestive of TB  are as listed above. Infants are more likely to have nonspecific 
symptoms like low-grade fever, cough, weight loss, failure to thrive, and signs like wheezing, reduced 
breath sounds, tachypnoea and respiratory distress.
• Positive TST test  (≥10 mm induration at 72 hours; tuberculin strength of 10 IU PPD).
• Suggestive chest X-ray  changes:
• Enlarged hilar Iymph nodes +/- localised obstructive emphysema Persistent segmental collapse 
consolidation not responding to conventional antibiotics.
• Calcification in Iymph nodes - usually develops > 6 months after infection.
• CXR changes in young infant/ children can be non-specific
• Laboratory tests:  Presence of AFB on smears of clinical specimens and positive histopathology or 
cytopathology on tissue specimens are highly suggestive of TB. Isolation of M. tuberculosis by culture 
from appropriate specimens is confirmatory.Diagnosis of TB diseaseDefinition

susceptibility.
• If the index case is known, its culture and susceptibility results can be used to guide the therapy.
• The diagnostic work-up for TB disease is tailored to the organ system most likely affected as summarised 
in the table above.
• Antimicrobial therapy for TB disease requires a multidrug treatment regimen. Drug selection is 
dependent on drug susceptibility in the area the TB is acquired (especially refugee patients), disease 
burden and exposure to previous TB medications and HIV prevalence. If needed, treatment regimen can 
be adjusted once drug susceptibility is available.
• Directly observed therapy is recommended for treatment of active TB.
• Drug resistant TB can be considered if the source has drug resistant TB or confirmed if investigations 
(XpertUltra and sensitivity) indicate resistance.
• Infants with TB, severe TB, disseminated TB and HIV with TB should be managed in consultation with 
Paediatric ID.Diagnostic Work-up
Treatment of TB diseaseThe tests to consider include but are not limited to the following:
Pulmonary TB:
• Chest radiograph
• Early morning gastric aspirates/nasopharyngeal aspirate1
• Sputum1 (if > 12 years or younger but able to expectorate sputum)
• Pleural fluid1 or biopsy1
Central Nervous System (CNS) TB
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for FEME, acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear, TB culture and molecular testing.
• Computed tomography scan (CT) head with contrast/MRI
TB Lymph node
• Excisional biopsy or fine needle aspirate1
Abdominal TB
• CT abdomen with contrast/ultrasound abdomen
• Biopsy of mass/mesenteric lymph node1
TB osteomyelitis
• CT/MRI of affected limb
• Biopsy of affected site
Miliary/Disseminated TB
• As for pulmonary TB
• Early morning urine and CSF1
1Note: All these specimens should be sent for AFB smear and TB culture and susceptibility testing. 
Molecular testing e.g., UltraXpert should be send if smear negative. Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) for 
pleural fluid and Cytopathology/histopathology should be carried out on appropriate specimens. All 
children evaluated require a chest x-ray to rule out pulmonary TB.

• Treatment regimens have 2 phases, an initial intensive phase followed by continuation phase:
• Intensive Phase  (2 months): consists of daily Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide. A 4th drug 
(Ethambutol) is usually added especially when initial drug resistance may be present or for extensive 
disease e.g. miliary TB or where prevalence of HIV is high.
• Maintenance Phase  (4 months): Isoniazid and rifampicin for the remaining 4 months daily
• Children tolerates TB drug better with less side effect than adult. TB dosage calculated as per kg of body

severe miliary disease (if hypoxic) and endobronchial disease.
• Steroids should be given only when accompanied by appropriate anti- TB therapy.
• Dosage: prednisolone 1-2mg/kg per day (max. 40 mg daily) for first 3-4 week, then taper over 3-4 
weeks.
Indications for baseline and routine monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin are recommended for:
• Severe TB disease.
• Clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity.
• Underlying hepatic disease.
• Use of other hepatotoxic drugs (especially anticonvulsants).
• HIV infection.
• Routine testing of serum transaminases in healthy children with none of the above risk factors is not 
necessary.
• Children on Ethambutol should be monitored for visual acuity and colour discrimination.
• TB treatment in lactating mothers is safe as the amount of drug ingested by the baby is minimal. Hence 
if the mother is already on treatment and is non-infective, the baby can be breastfed.
• Women who are receiving isoniazid and are breastfeeding should receive pyridoxine.
• If the mother is diagnosed to have active pulmonary TB and is still infective:
1. The newborn should be separated from the mother for at least one week while the mother is being 
treated.
2. Mother should wear a surgical mask subsequently while breast feeding until she is asymptomatic 
and her sputum is AFB-smear negative.
3. Breast feeding is best avoided during this period, however, expressed breast milk can be given.
4.  The infant should be evaluated for congenital TB. If this is excluded, BCG is deferred and the baby 
should receive isoniazid for 3 months and then tuberculin tested.
5. If tuberculin negative and mother has been adherent to treatment and non-infectious, isoniazid can 
be discontinued and BCG given.
6. If tuberculin positive, the infant should be reassessed for TB disease and if disease is not present, 
isoniazid is continued for total of 6 months and BCG given at the end of treatment.
7. Other close household contacts should be evaluated for TB.

Section 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASE• Children < 5 years especially those below 2 years old with LTBI have the highest risk of progression to 
active TB including disseminated and CNS TB.
• Active TB usually develops within two years of infection but can occurred within weeks in infants.
• Early investigation and treatment for LTBI are necessary to prevent active TB.
LTBI in children is a diagnosis established by:
1. Demonstrating prior TB infection using a LTBI test either TST or IGRA.
2. Excluding active TB disease with symptoms screening and chest-X-ray.
• Evaluation for active TB must be pursued in all children with a positive TST or IGRA. Children with LTBI 
should be totally asymptomatic and their chest-X-ray are usually normal.
** In immunocompromised children, both IGRAs and TST should be interpreted with caution.
The following are children with high-risk of progression to active TB:
• Household contacts* of bacteriologically confirmed PTB
• Infant and children living with HIV
• Other risk group including those immunocompromised children having anti-TNF treatment, ESRF on 
dialysis, diabetes and organ or haematological transplant recipients

b. Isoniazid and rifapentine weekly for three months (12 doses) (3HP).
c. Isoniazid and Rifampicin daily for three months (3HR).
d. Isoniazid daily for six or nine months (6H/9H).
• The preferred regimens for LTBI treatment are:
1. 4R for all children >28 days of age or 3HP for children aged >2 years.
2. 6H for all newborns aged 28 days and below.
• Alternative regimens include 3HR, 6H or 9H.
• In HIV-infected children with LTBI, 6H is the preferred regimen for:
1. Children <2 years of age.
2. Children ≥2 years of age on antiretroviral treatment with Rifamycin drug interaction
The objectives of follow-up during and after LTBI treatment in children:
• Monitor progression to active TB.
• Identify possible ADR.
• Monitor and ensure adherence.
• Adjust treatment dose according to the latest body weight.
• In general, clinical monitoring every four to six weeks for the first three months is appropriate, followed 
by every two to three months thereafter, regardless of regimen used.
• The duration of follow-up is at least two years from initiation of treatment.
Routine LFT monitoring is not needed in children receiving LTBI treatment but is warranted for children 
who develop clinical symptoms of liver injury. If the LFT is deranged the patient should be managed in 
consultation with expert. Counselling and support of patients and families on the importance of LTBI 
treatment will improve treatment acceptance and adherence. As LTBI treatment is given to a child who is 
otherwise well and healthy, development of any unexpected ADR may affect the adherence and parents 
may default subsequent follow-up. Therefore, it is important to educate the patient and family about 
potential ADRs. They should understand the need to stop treatment and seek medical advice immediately if 
signs or symptoms of drug toxicity are suspected.LTBI treatment regimen

BCG Lymphadenitis
In Malaysia, BCG is given intradermally at birth to prevent disseminated TB including TB meningitis. 
• Regional lymphadenopathy is one of the more common complications of BCG vaccination and arises as 
a result of enlargement of ipsilateral lymph nodes, principally involving the axillary node.
• Differential diagnoses to consider are:
• Pyogenic lymphadenitis.
• Tuberculous lymphadenitis.
• Non-tuberculous lymphadenitis.
• The following are features suggestive of BCG lymphadenitis
• History of BCG vaccination on the ipsilateral arm.
• Onset usually 2 to 4 months after BCG vaccination, although it may range from 2 weeks to 6 
months. Almost all cases occur within 24 months.
• There is absence of fever or other constitutional symptoms.
• Absent or minimal local tenderness over the lesion(s).
• >95% of cases involve ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, but supraclavicular or cervical glands may be 
involved in isolation or in association with axillary lymphadenopathy.
• Only 1 to 2 discrete lymph nodes are enlarged (clinically palpable) in the majority of cases.  Involved 
lymph nodes are rarely matted together.
• Two forms of lymphadenitis can be recognized:
a. non-suppurative or simple  which may resolve spontaneously within a few weeks – this is a normal 
reaction and may go unnoticed. 
b. suppurative   -  involves an enlarging lymph node with fluctuant appearances, oedema and 
erythema of the overlying skin and increased pigmentation. Happens in 30-80% of cases of 
lymphadenitis.
• Once suppuration has occurred, the subsequent course is usually one of spontaneous perforation, 
discharge and sinus formation. Healing eventually takes place through cicatrization and closure of the 
sinus, the process taking several months with possible scarring.
Correct Technique to give BCG Vaccination
Needle
Short (10mm) 26-27 gauge needle with a short bevel using a BCG or insulin syringe
Site
Left arm at Deltoid insertion
Dose
• 0.05 mls for infants (< 1 year of age)
• 0.1 ml for children > 1 year.
Route
Intradermal
Do not give BCG at other sites where the lymphatic drainage makes subsequent lymphadenitis difficult 
to diagnose and dangerous (especially on buttock where lymphatic drains to inguinal and deep aortic 
nodes).

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASECareful history and examination are important to diagnose BCG adenitis
• BCG lymphadenitis without suppuration (no fluctuation)
• Most non suppurative BCG lymph nodes will regress without intervention in 4 – 6 months and can 
be managed conservatively
• Drugs are not required. 
• Reassurance and follow-up is advised.
• Several controlled trials and a recent meta analysis (Cochrane database) have suggested that drugs 
such as antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin) or antituberculous drugs neither hasten resolution nor 
prevent its progression into suppuration.
• BCG lymphadenitis with suppuration (fluctuation) 
• Needle aspiration is recommended. Usually one aspiration is effective, but repeated aspirations may 
be needed for some patients.
• Surgical excision may be needed when needle aspiration has failed (as in the case of matted and 
multiloculated nodes) or when suppurative nodes have already drained with sinus formation.
A  systemic review of five RCTs showed that fine needle aspiration shortens the resolution of BCG abscess 
at 6 months,  prevents spontaneous perforation and associated complications and shortens the duration of 
healing and is safe.
The following findings may indicate disseminated BCG infection:
• Systemic manifestations: fever, anemia, loss or poor weight gain.
• Distant lymph node(s) enlargement, beyond the ipsilateral lymph node(s) such as right axillary or 
inguinal. 
• Cutaneous lesions or abscesses beyond the region of vaccination
• Hepatosplenomegaly.
• Bone tenderness or swelling reflecting underlying osteomyelitis.
• Signs of meningeal involvement, such as seizures.
The investigations should be obtained with guidance of pediatric immunology and infectious diseases 
specialists. These may include identification of the M. bovis  from the patient’s organs by culture and/or 
standard PCR, as well as typical histopathological changes with granulomatous inflammation, in addition to 
identifying the specific underlying immunodeficiency status. Radiological investigations such as bone scan 
and abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan may be beneficial in evaluating the site(s) and extent of 
dissemination.  Thus all infants presenting with BCG lymphadenitis should be followed up till resolution. Investigations for disseminated BCG infectionAssessmentMANAGEMENT

Dengue Viral Infections
• Dengue virus infections affect all age groups and produce a spectrum of illness that ranges from 
asymptomatic to a mild or nonspecific viral illness to severe and occasionally fatal disease.
• The traditional 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of dengue was changed to 
the 2009 WHO classifications that encompass various categories of dengue since dengue exists in 
continuum.
• The term DHF used in previous classification put too much emphasis on hemorrhage; However, 
the hallmark of severe dengue (and the manifestation that should be addressed early) IS NOT 
HEMORRHAGE but increased vascular permeability that would lead to shock.
This system divides dengue into TWO major categories of severity:
• Dengue: with or without warning signs, and
• Severe dengue.Introduction
CLASSIFICATION OF DENGUE VIRAL INFECTIONS, WHO 2009
Criteria for dengue with or without warning signs (adapted from WHO 2009 dengue classification and 
severity)
Probable Dengue
*Live in and travel to dengue endemic area
*Fever and any 2 of the following:
1.  Nausea, vomiting
2.  Rash
3.  Aches and pain
4.  Leucopenia
5.  Any warning signs
Laboratory confirmed dengue
(important when no sign of plasma leakage)Warning Signs
Clinical:
• Continuous abdominal pain (not intermittent) 
or tenderness
• Persistent vomiting (≥2 episodes of vomiting 
that amounts to fatigue or requires intravenous 
fluids)
• Clinical fluid accumulation
• Mucosal bleed
• Lethargy, restlessness
• Liver enlargement > 2cm

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASE• Dengue is a complex and unpredictable disease but success can be achieved with mortality rates of 1% 
when care is given in timely manner.
• The best part is, the care is simple and inexpensive since ALL that is needed is clinical acumen, knowing 
different phases of dengue and what to expect during these phases. 
• There is currently no specific anti-viral for dengue hence therapy is targeted to those individuals with 
capillary leakage needing fluid therapy, reversing shock when it happens and stopping fluid when the 
individual enters recovery phase.
• The timing of intervention starts at frontline healthcare personnel whether they are in A&E or OPD or 
even health clinics. This involve early recognition that the child that presents to you do indeed have 
dengue.
• The healthcare personnel involved in managing dengue cases day to day need to familiarize themselves 
with the THREE main well demarcated phases of dengue: febrile, critical; and recovery (see next page)
• Since dengue is endemic in Malaysia; all children that presents to us with persistent fever without any 
obvious source need to have dengue as a differential.
• PROBABLE CASE DEFINITION OF DENGUE can be used to suspect whether a child with fever has dengue 
or not.
Example: a 5-year-old child with 2 days of persistent fever without any obvious source, who also has 
body aches and abdominal pain fulfills the case definition of probable dengue.
• In early phase of disease, it is difficult to differentiate dengue with other childhood illness; therefore, 
using probable case definition and performing FBC at first   encounter would be useful to differentiate 
dengue from other illness.
• Temporal relationship of fever cessation (defervescence) is important as, in DENGUE (unlike other viral 
illness) manifest its severity (leakage/ shock) when temperature seems to have declined.Management of children with DengueCriteria for Severe Dengue
1. Severe plasma leakage leading to:
• Shock (Dengue Shock Syndrome)
• Fluid accumulation (pleural effusion, ascites) with respiratory distress
2. Severe bleeding
As evaluated by paediatrician
3. Severe organ involvement:
• Liver: elevated transaminases (AST or ALT ≥ 1000)
• CNS: impaired consciousness, seizures
• Heart and other organ involvementDengue can be diagnosed through:
• Detection of dengue virus protein by non-
structural protein 1 antigen (NS1 Ag): rapid 
test/ELISA
• Antibody detection of IgM/IgG(serology)
• Combination of NS1 Ag with IgM/IgG (combo 
test)
• OR
• Genome detection by RT-PCR or virus isolation

satisfactory, and the caregiver is educated regarding fever control and avoidance of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents (NSAIDS). 
• They should also be familiar with the course of illness (natural history) and be educated on when to 
bring the child back to healthcare facilities. (refer Appendix 4, CPG Dengue in Children 2nd edition)
• Home Care Advice for Children with Dengue card/leaflet that emphasizes on danger/warning signs 
is also important. This should be given to parents/guardian for all children who are managed as 
outpatient.
• These children need daily clinical and/or laboratory assessment by trained doctors or nurses until the 
danger period has passed and they had recovered from dengue.
• Monitor these children using Dengue Monitoring Record (Appendix 5, CPG Dengue in children, 2nd edition)
If dengue is suspected or confirmed, disease notification is mandatory.
• Presence of warning signs.
• Features of severe dengue
• Infants.
• Children with co-morbid factors (e.g. diabetes, renal failure, immune compromised state, 
hemoglobinopathies and obesity).
• Social factors - living far from health facilities, transport issues.
The THREE major priorities of managing hospitalized patient with dengue in the critical phase are:
A - Replacement of plasma losses.
B - Early recognition and treatment of hemorrhage.
C - Prevention of fluid overload.
• Fluid therapy in a patient with dengue shock has two parts: initial, rapid fluid boluses to reverse shock 
followed by titrated fluid volumes to match ongoing losses.
• However, for a patient who has warning signs of plasma leakage but is not yet in shock, the initial fluid 
boluses may not be necessary.
• Fluids in dengue MUST be managed in way that it is given ONLY when it is needed and off when patient 
enter convalescent/recovery phase.
• Haemodynamic state should be used as MAIN driver of IVF therapy. HCT as guide. Not the other way 
around.
• Limit fluid in febrile phase. If IVF is needed to correct hydration, USE only isotonic solutions (example NS).
• During the febrile phase of dengue, one of the complications that can occur is dehydration. Please look 
for the severity of this and correct and support the child ‘s fluid need with combination of ORS, IVF and 
encourage the child’s normal dietary intake.1. Establish whether patient has dengue or not
2. Determine phase of illness
3. Recognize warning signs and/or the presence of severe dengue if present.
4. Does the child have co-morbidities that put the child at high risk of having severe dengue?
5. Does the child need admission, or can the child be managed as out-patient?

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASEGuidelines for reversing dengue shock while minimizing fluid overload
Severe dengue with compensated shock:
• Stabilize airway and breathing, obtain baseline Hct level, initiate fluid resuscitation with NS/RL at 10-
20 mL/kg over 1 hr, and insert urine catheter for objective measurement of urine output.
Severe dengue with hypotension:
• Should be managed more vigorously.
• Secure IV access as soon as possible (within 5 minutes) and obtain baseline HCT. At the same time 
stabilize airway and breathing 
• Initiate fluid resuscitation with 1-2 boluses of 20 mL/kg NS/RL or
• synthetic colloid over 15-30 mins until pulse is palpable, slow down fluid rates when hemodynamics 
improves.
• Repeat second bolus of 10 mL/kg colloid if shock persists and Hct level is still high
• Synthetic colloids may limit the severity of fluid overload in severe shock.
• Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is currently not recommended in DSS. Use colloid that you are familiar with.
End points/goals for rapid fluid boluses:
• Improve circulation as evidenced by decreasing tachycardia, improving BP and pulse volume, warm 
and pink extremities and CRT <2 seconds (Table 1 : Hemodynamic assessment)
• Improve end-organ perfusion as evidenced by improving consciousness level and urine output.
• Achieve appropriate decrease in HCT
 ͳIf baseline Hct level is low or “normal” in presence of shock, hemorrhage likely to have worsened 
shock, transfuse fresh WB or fresh PRBCs early.
• After rapid fluid boluses, continue isotonic fluid titration to match ongoing plasma leakage for 24–48 
hrs; if patient not vomiting and is alert after shock, correction with oral rehydration fluids may suffice 
to match ongoing losses.
• Check Hct level 2-4 hourly for first 6 hrs and decrease frequency as patient improves.
Goals for ongoing fluid titration:
• Stable vital signs, serial Hct measurement showing gradual normalization (if not bleeding), and low 
normal hourly urine output are the most objective goals indicating adequate circulating volume; 
adjust fluid rate downward when this is achieved.
• Plasma leakage is intermittent even during the first 24 hrs after the onset of shock; hence, fluid 
requirements are dynamic.
• Targeting a minimally acceptable hourly urine output (0.5-1 mL/kg/hr) is an effective and inexpensive 
monitoring modality that can signal shock correction and minimize fluid overload.
• A urine output of 1.5–2 mL/kg/hr should prompt reduction in fluid infusion rates, provided 
hyperglycemia has been ruled out.
• Separate maintenance fluids are not usually required; glucose and potassium may be administered 
separately only if low.
• Hypotonic fluids can cause fluid overload; also, avoid glucose- containing fluids, such as 1/2Glucose 
Normal Saline (GNS or I/2 GNS): the resultant hyperglycemia can cause osmotic diuresis and delay 
correction of hypovolemia. Tight glucose monitoring is recommended to avoid hyper/hypoglycemia.
• Commence early enteral feeds when vital signs are stable, usually 4–8 hrs after admission.
• All invasive procedures (intubation, central lines, and arterial cannulation) must be avoided; if 
essential, they must be performed by the most experienced person. Orogastric tubes are preferred to 
nasogastric tubes. Avoid repeated veno-puncture.
• Significant hemorrhage mandates early fresh WB or fresh PRBC transfusion; minimize/avoid 
transfusions of other blood products, such as platelets and fresh-frozen plasma unless bleeding is 
uncontrolled despite 2–3 aliquots of fresh WB or PRBCs.

** It is recommended that baseline hematocrit is obtained for all cases and repeat hematocrit done following each fluid 
resuscitation to look at child ‘s response and to plan subsequent fluid administration. In PICU/HDW settings, ABG machine can be 
used to look at HCT and in general wards, either, SPIN PCV or FBC (sent to lab).

Section 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASEInterpretation of hematocrit (HCT)
• Baseline HCT on the first three days of illness is a useful reference point. 
• The rise of HCT level beyond 20% of the baseline during critical phase indicates significant plasma 
leakage and the need for IV fluid therapy.
• HCT alone is not the driver for fluid therapy. 
• The interpretation of HCT will be most meaningful if the corresponding hemodynamic state and 
response to fluid therapy are known at the time of blood sampling
 ͳA rising or persistently high HCT with unstable vital signs indicates active plasma leakage and the 
need for a further bolus of fluid resuscitation.
 ͳA rising or persistently high HCT in patients with stable vital signs and adequate urine output 
does not require extra IV fluid. Continue to monitor closely and usually the HCT will start to fall 
within the next 24 - 48 hours as plasma leakage stops.
 ͳA decrease in HCT with signs of shock may indicate major occult haemorrhage and urgent 
transfusion with fresh packed red cells/ fresh whole blood is needed. Occult bleeding may take 
several hours to become apparent and the patient’s HCT will continue to decrease without 
achieving haemodynamic stability.
 ͳA decrease in HCT with stable vital signs and adequate urine output, indicates haemodilution or 
reabsorption of extravasated fluids. This signifies the start of recovery phase and IV fluids must 
be discontinued immediately to avoid pulmonary oedema
The following table shows the normal range of HCT in different age groups.
Age HCT (%)

diphtheria, laryngeal or laryngotracheal diphtheria, and cutaneous diphtheria.
• Diphtheria may cause systemic complication such as myocarditis (mortality 50%), neuritis presenting as 
paralysis of soft palate and rarely non-oliguric acute kidney injury.
• All suspected and confirmed patients must be placed under strict isolation until bacteriological 
clearance has been demonstrated after completing treatment. Strict droplet precautions and hand 
hygiene must be observed by healthcare workers.
• Obtain specimens for culture from nose, throat, or any mucosal membrane (tissue). Obtain specimen 
before the commencement of antibiotic and specimen must be transported to the laboratory promptly.
• Notify laboratory personnel as special tellurite enriched culture media (Lofler’s or Tindale’s) are needed.
• Definitive treatment:
• Early, single dose of IV infusion (over 60 minutes) diphtheria antitoxin should be administered on 
the basis of clinical diagnosis, even before culture results are available.
• Tests for hypersensitivity is recommended for IV administration.Introduction

• Had received adequate penicillin regime as per national/local treatment guideline. (Mother with 
late latent syphilis/unknown stage of disease requires 3 dose of IM benzathine Penicillin given 1 
week apart) AND
• Treatment completed more than 30 days prior to delivery with NO possibility  or reinfection (i.e., 
single sexual partner/husband who are fully treated/not infected/ NOT  recently diagnosed with 
syphilis/NO Risk of reinfection) AND
• Documented 4-fold decrease in RPR/VDRL titre OR remained low and stable (i.e., serofast) before 
and during pregnancy and at delivery (e.g., VDRL< 1:2/RPR< 1:4).
**If mother status unsure for any reasons, cases may be discussed with attending FMS/dermatologist to 
ascertain their treatment status
2. Mother is considered as “not completed treatment”  if any of the criteria in note 1  above is NOT met
3. Clinical features of congenital syphilis:  non-immune hydrops, IUGR, jaundice (direct/conjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia), hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, skin rash, pseudoparalysis of extremity.
4. CSF analysis  (nontraumatic tap): Normal value differed by gestational age and higher in preterm infants. 
Newborn  ≤16-19 WBCs/mm3 or protein level of ≤115-118 mg/dL. 2nd month  of life  ≤9-11 WBCs/mm3 
or protein level ≤89-91 mg/dL. Older infant  5 WBCs/mm3 and protein level of 40 mg/dL considered 
as upper limit of normal. For infant with abnormal initial CSF at birth, LP should be repeated if RPR 
remained positive after 6-12 months.
5. Other tests, as clinically indicated:  long-bone x-ray, CXR, LFT, cranial ultra-sound, ophthalmologic 
examination and auditory brainstem response.
6. For infant with a reactive RPR but not treated AND follow up cannot be ensured , option to give single 
dose of IM Benzathine Penicillin G 50,000 units/kg. However, infants born to mother with untreated 
early syphilis at time of delivery are at increased risk of congenital syphilis, full course of treatment 
should be considered even if the infant RPR is nonreactive.
7. Notification:  ALL cases of suspected/probable/proven congenital syphilis MUST be notified to local 
health department irrespective of treatment was given or not.
8. Follow up:  All sero-reactive infants/infant born to sero-reactive mother should receive careful follow 
up examination and serologic testing as mentioned above. VDRL/RPR titre s hould decline by age of 3 
month  and should be non-reactive by age of 6 month  if the infants were not infected or were infected 
but adequately treated.
* RPR indicates rapid plasma reagin test; and VDRL, Veneral Disease Research Laboratory slide test. RPR is 
currently the preferred nontreponemal test  for syphilis in all MOH facilities. Nontreponemal test may be 
falsely negative/nonreactive in early primary syphilis, latent acquired syphilis of long duration , and  late 
congenital syphilis . Occasionally, RPR/VDRL test performed on serum sample containing high concentration 
of T pallidum antibody will be weakly reactive or falsely negative (known as prozone phenomenon); diluting 
the serum will result in a positive test.
* RPR titre are generally higher than VDRL, therefore when RPR/VDRL are used to monitor treatment 
response, same test must be used throughout the follow up period, preferably performed in the same 
laboratory, to ensure comparability of result.
* In order to compare infant RPR titre with maternal titre at birth, ensure mother blood taken at or 
immediately after delivery, and test performed in the same laboratory. Infant RPR test on umbilical cord 
sampling is not recommended as umbilical cord may be contaminated with maternal blood and could yield 
a false-positive result. Wharton’s jelly within the umbilical cord also can yield a false negative result.NOTES TO ALGORITHM ON PREVIOUS PAGE:

Paediatric COVID-19
• The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a 
pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which continues to cause infections worldwide. 
• COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets but may also spread by airborne 
transmission or contact with surfaces.
• Children with the following conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease:
 ÊMedical comorbidities (congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, diabetes)
 ÊImmunosuppression
 ÊObesity
 ÊYoung infants 
• The diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can be made either through a reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or antigen detection test.
• RT-PCR has higher sensitivity, but antigen detection tests are more accessible and convenient. Antigen 
tests are also less costly and have a shorter turnaround time.
• Upper respiratory samples (via a nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasal/
oropharyngeal swab) are the primary specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral tests.
 ÊSamples from the endotracheal aspirate may be used for ventilated patients.
 ÊSaliva samples can be a convenient point-of-care test, but results should be interpreted with 
caution, especially if the test was conducted without clinical supervision. Clinicians should also be 
mindful of potential reliability issues with the wide variety of brands available in the market.
• Clinical pointers:
 ÊClinicians who use RT-PCR testing should be aware that the RT-PCR may remain positive for a 
considerable period even after the child has recovered from the infection and may incorrectly 
attribute an unrelated current infection to COVID-19.
 ÊClinicians who use antigen testing should be aware of the lower sensitivity compared to RT-PCR, and 
negative antigen tests performed may warrant confirmation with additional testing if the clinical 
suspicion remains high.
 ÊPotential false-negative results could occur caused by low viral loads, improper sampling timing (too 
early or too late), poor technique, or sample degradation during sample transport.
 ÊTesting for other respiratory viruses (eg influenza and RSV) may be warranted depending on the 
clinical presentation as coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory pathogens can occur.• The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2-14 days with an average of 3 days.
• Pediatric COVID-19 manifests in a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic infection to 
symptomatic disease which overlaps with common clinical syndromes such as upper respiratory tract 
infection, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, viral croup, asthma, febrile seizures and acute gastroenteritis.
• Clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion since the symptoms and clinical manifestations of 
COVID-19 are non-specific, especially when there are high rates of community transmission, or if the 
child is in close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected infection.Introduction

Section 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASE• Serology testing have limited utility for diagnosis in the acute setting since antibodies towards SARS-
CoV-2 generally take several weeks to develop.
 ÊSerology tests have the highest sensitivity three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms. 
 ÊTherefore, serology testing would be useful for assessing patients with suspected MIS-C, for 
determining past or recent infection, and for sero-surveillance studies.  
 ÊIf a serologic test was performed on an individual who has received a spike protein COVID-19 
vaccine, it is best to perform a test that detects antibodies to antigens other than the spike protein, 
such as the nucleocapsid protein. 
• Full blood count findings in children with COVID-19 are non-specific, but may include mild abnormalities 
in white blood cell count (either increased or decreased lymphocyte counts).
• Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) might not be raised even in children with severe 
COVID-19 pneumonia.
• Radiologic findings in children with COVID-19 include unilateral or bilateral infiltrates on chest 
radiograph, which can be indistinguishable from pneumonia due to other respiratory viral pathogens.

initial results were abnormal or if there is evidence of clinical deterioration.Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)• COVID-19 generally runs a mild clinical course in most children. A study among Malaysian children 
revealed that severe pneumonia presents early in the course of illness, with a median of 3 days of 
illness before hospitalization. 
• The decision for hospital admission should be guided by clinical evaluation, underlying comorbidities, 
social and geographical factors, and phase of illness. 
• Patients should be isolated in the highest level of isolation available in the ward. Airborne precautions 
would be required if the child receives nebulized medications, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive or 
mechanical ventilation. 
• The management of pediatric COVID-19 is largely symptomatic with consideration of the presenting 
clinical syndrome such as upper respiratory tract infection, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, exacerbation of 
asthma, croup, gastroenteritis, or febrile seizures.
• Corticosteroids:
 ÊMay be beneficial in patients with severe respiratory disease on mechanical ventilation. 
 ÊDose of Dexamethasone (IV or oral): 0.15mg/kg/day (max dose 6mg) for a total of 7-10 days.
• Other medications:
 ÊVenous thromboembolism prophylaxis may be required in patients who are obese and mechanically 
ventilated.
 ÊIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) would be beneficial in patients who meet the criteria for MIS-C.
 ÊAntivirals such as Remdesivir may be considered for high-risk patients who present in the early 
viremic phase after consultation with the pediatric infectious disease specialist.
 ÊPaxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) has not been licensed for children under 12 years of age at time of 
writing.
 ÊOther immunomodulatory agents (eg anti IL-1, anti IL-6) may be considered for patients with severe 
disease after consultation with the pediatric infectious disease specialist.
• Immunization:
 ÊPediatric vaccination for COVID-19 is discussed separately (refer to National pediatric COVID-19 
vaccination guidelines).Management

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 14       INFECTIOUS DISEASE• Intravenous immunoglobulin:
 ÊDose: 2g/kg infused over 8-12 hours. 
 ÊFor children who are obese, the dose should be based on the ideal body weight (max dose 100g/
day).
 ÊFor patients with significant cardiac dysfunction, IVIG may be infused in divided doses over two days 
to reduce the risk of fluid overload.
 ÊBlood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies should be collected prior to administration of IVIG.
 ÊTreatment with IVIG alone may be reasonable in patients with mild disease without evidence of 
cardiovascular compromise.
 ÊRepeated doses of IVIG are generally not recommended due to the risk of volume overload and 
hemolytic anemia.
• Steroids:
 ÊGlucocorticoids can be used in combination with IVIG for patients with moderate to severe 
manifestations, or as second line therapy in mild cases when there is inadequate response to IVIG 
(eg persistent fever, rising inflammatory markers), or as monotherapy in mild cases when IVIG is 
unavailable.
 ÊGlucocorticoid therapy can be initiated with IV Methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg/day in two divided 
doses (max daily dose 60-80mg).
 ÊThis can be converted to an equivalent oral dose of Prednisolone once the patient improves 
clinically and tapered off over two to three weeks.
 ÊIn life-threatening or refractory cases, pulsed IV Methylprednisolone 10-30 mg/kg/day (max daily 
dose 1g) for one to three days may be used.
• Aspirin for most patients:
 ÊDose: 3-5mg/kg/day, max 81mg/day 
 ÊDuration: 4-6 weeks or until normalization of inflammatory markers and LV function. 
 ÊConsult pediatric cardiologist for recommended dose and duration of aspirin if coronary artery 
aneurysm present.
 ÊContraindications: patients with platelet counts < 80,000, active bleeding, or having intercurrent 
viral infection (eg varicella).Treatment of MIS-C
• VTE prophylaxis:
 ÊRecommended in patients with severe disease who at high risk for venous thromboembolism (eg 
obesity, malignancy, family history of thrombophilia, severe cardiac dysfunction, central venous 
catheters, immobility)
 ÊIn young children, the decision is made on a case-to-case basis. 
 ÊWhen VTE is used, LMWH is the preferred agent. Dose:
 ▪<60kg: SC Enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg bd

Atopic Dermatitis
• A chronic inflammatory itchy skin condition that usually develops in early childhood and follows a 
remitting and relapsing course. It often has a genetic component.
• Leads to the breakdown of the skin barrier making the skin susceptible to trigger factors, including 
irritants and allergens, which can make the eczema worse.
• Although not often thought of as a serious medical condition, it can have a significant impact on quality 
of life.
• Infection: Bacterial, viral or fungal
• Emotional stress
• Sweating and itching
• Irritants: Hand washing soap, detergents
• Extremes of weathers
• Allergens
• Food: egg, peanuts, milk, fish, soy, wheat.
• Aeroallergens: house dust mite, pollen, animal dander and molds.Introduction

• The severity.
• Patient’s understanding and expectation of the disease and the treatment process.
• Patient’s social circumstances.
• Comprehensive patient education is paramount, and a good doctor-patient relationship is essential for 
long-term successful management.
• In an acute flare-up of atopic dermatitis, evaluate for the following factors:
• Poor patient compliance
• Secondary infection: bacterial (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), viral
• (e.g. herpes simplex virus)
• Persistent contact irritant/allergen.
• Physical trauma, scratching, friction, sweating and adverse environmental factors.
• Baths soothe itching and removes crusting. They should be lukewarm and limited to 10 minutes 
duration. Avoid soaps. Use soap substitute
e.g. aqueous cream or emulsifying ointment.
• Moisturizers work to reduce dryness in the skin by trapping moisture.
• Apply to normal and abnormal skin at least twice a day and more frequently in severe cases.
• Emollients are best applied after bath. Offer a choice of unperfumed emollients and suitable to the 
child’s needs and preferences,
e.g. Aqueous cream, Ung. Emulsificans, and vaseline.
N.B. Different classes of moisturizer are based on their mechanism of action, including occlusives, 
humectants, emollients and protein rejuvenators. In acute exudation form KMNO4 1:10,000 solutions or 
normal saline daps or soaks are useful – as mild disinfectant and desiccant.Management

• Topical steroid are often prescribed intermittently for short term reactive treatment of acute flares and 
supplemented by emollients.
• Choice depends on a balance between efficacy and side-effects.
• The more potent the steroid, the more the side-effect.
• Apply steroid cream once or twice daily.
• Avoid sudden discontinuation to prevent rebound phenomenon.
• Use milder steroids for face, flexures and scalp.
• Amount of topical steroid to be used – the finger tip (FTU) is convenient way of indicating to patients 
how much of a topical steroid should be applied to skin at any one site. 1 FTU is the amount of steroid 
expressed from the tube to cover the length of the flexor aspect of the terminal phalanx of the patient’s 
index finger.
• Number of FTU required for the different body areas.
• 1 hand/foot/face      1 FTU
• 1 arm                                   3 FTU

Section 15       DERMATOLOGY• Secondary bacterial skin infection is common and may cause acute exacerbation of eczema. Systemic 
antibiotics are necessary when there is evidence of extensive infection.
• Commonly Staphyloccus aureus.
• Useful in exudation form where superinfection occurs .
• Choice:
• Oral cloxacillin 15mg/kg/day 6 hourly for 7-14 days, or
• Oral Erythromycin / cephalosporin
• Secondary infection can arise from Herpes simplex virus causing Eczema Herpeticum . Treatment using 
antiviral e.g. Acyclovir may be necessary.
• Refractory cases do not response to conventional topical therapy and have extensive eczema. Refer to 
a Dermatologist (who may use systemic steroids, interferon, Cyclosporine A, Azathioprine, Dupilumab, 
JAK inhibitors or/and phototherapy).
• Tendency towards improvement throughout childhood.
• Two third will clear by adolescence.• Avoid woolen toys, clothes, bedding.
• Reduce use of detergent (esp. biological).
• BCG contraindicated till skin improves.
• Swimming is useful (MUST apply moisturizer immediately upon exiting pool).
• Avoid Aggravating Factors.
• Check compliance.
• Suspect secondary infection – send for skin swab; start antibiotics.
• Exclude scabies.
• For severe eczema, emollient and topical steroid can be applied under occlusion with ‘wet wrap’. This 
involves the use of a layer of wet, followed by a layer of dry Tubifast to the affected areas i.e. limbs and 
trunk. The benefits are probably due to cooling by evaporation, relieving pruritus, enhanced absorption 
of the topical steroid and physical protection of the excoriation.Treatment of secondary infection

Common Cutaneous Infections
1. Molluscum Contangiosum
• Common and benign viral skin infection caused by a member of the pox virus, called molluscum 
contangiosum virus (MCV).
• Transmitted via autoinoculation, physical contact with infected person, contaminated fomite or 
sexual contact.
• Incubation period: 2 weeks to 6 months
• Clinical features: 
 ÊSolitary or multiple, grouped, pearly white, or flesh-coloured, dome-shaped papules with 
central umbilication 
 ÊLesions vary in size from 1mm-10mm; giant lesions are primarily seen in HIV patients. 
 Êcommonly found in areas with friction with clothing such as trunk and abdomen. 
 ÊCan persist from weeks to months.
 ÊBOTE (Beginning of the end) sign refers to skin redness and swelling of a molluscum lesion 
when the lesion starts to regress. This phenomenon is likely due to a host immune response 
towards the infection and could be mistaken as bacterial superinfection.
• Diagnosis is generally straightforward based on clinical features. Expression of a white cheesy 
material by lateral pressure on a lesion is classic. 
• Treatment options:
1. Wait and see approach  -in mild infections (not bothersome to the child or very few lesions) as 
spontaneous resolution may occur.
• Resolution usually takes 6-9 months but can persist for a few years.
2. Topical medications- could be offered as first line therapy and may take weeks to months to 
work:
i. Keratolytic agent:  Salicylic acid 10% -20% cream OD
ii. Irritating agent:  Benzoyl peroxide 10% cream, Retinoid cream e.g. tretinoin 0.05% OD
iii. Alkaline compound which dissolves keratin: Hydrogen peroxide 1-10% OD
iv. Vesicant agent: Cantharidin cream (blistering agent)- once in every 3-4 weeks
v. Immunomodulator: Imiquimod 5% 3 times a week• This Chapter will include 4 common cutaneous infections

Section 15       DERMATOLOGY2. Viral Warts (Verrucae)
• Common and benign viral infection of the skin and mucosae in children.
• Caused by non-malignant strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), except for sexually transmitted 
ones (type 16 and 18) which are associated with cervical, vulval and penile cancer.
• Transmitted via autoinoculation, physical contact with infected person, contaminated personal 
belongings, vertical transmission, or sexual contact.
• Incubation period: 1 to 6 months
• Clinical features:  
 ÊVary based on location (palmoplantar, periungual, respiratory, oral, anogenital etc.) and 
subtypes.
 ÊSubtypes of viral warts are as follows:
 ▪Common warts, also known as verruca vulgaris (HPV types 2 and 4)- present as 
hyperkeratotic papules with rough, irregular surface and can occur in almost any part of the 
body
 ▪Filiform/digitate warts- usually seen on the face, eyelids, lips, nares and neck. They are long 
and thin lesion protruding from the skin surface.
 ▪Flat warts, also known as verrucae planae or plane warts (HPV types 3 and 10)- present as 
smooth, flesh-coloured or hyperpigmented papules, mainly distributed over sun-exposed 
areas such as the face, the dorsum of hands.
 ▪Deep plantar warts/myrmecia (HPV types 1,4,7 and 10)- present as small papules and 
progress to deep lesion with a rough keratotic surface. It is usually surrounded by a well-
demarcated rim of compressed keratin.
 ▪Cystic warts (HPV 60,63 and 65)- appear as a nodule on the weightbearing surface of the 
sole. The surface is usually smooth but may become hyperkeratotic.
 ▪Mosaic warts ( HPV 1,4,7 and 10)- formed by smaller plantar warts which tend to coalesce 
over the palms or soles.
 ▪Condyloma acuminata also known as anogenital warts-present as multiple flesh-coloured, 
soft, verrucous papules which often are “mirror image” on each side of the anus. Other 
areas of involvement include the penile glans, shaft, scrotum, and vulva.
 ÊAlthough self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, lesions can persist from months to 
years.
 ÊCan be painful.
• Diagnosis is generally evident based on clinical features. 
• In a child diagnosed with condyloma acuminata, a thorough history taking, and physical 
examinations are important to look for evidence of sexual abuse.
• Treatment options:
1. Wait and see approach  -most lesions are reported to have spontaneous resolution within 2 
years.
2. Manual filing and pairing - using a scalpel.
3. Topical medications  -could be offered as first line therapy and may take weeks to months to 
work: 
i. Keratolytic agents:  Salicylic acid 10% -20% cream OD or applied nightly under occlusion 
using a tape, duct tape or plaster.
ii. Irritating agents:  Retinoid cream e.g. tretinoin 0.05% OD -might be more useful in flat 
warts.
iii. Cytotoxic chemotherapy: 5-flurouracil OD -suitable for facial flat warts, Podophyllotoxin 
0.5% cream OD
iv. Immunomodulator: Imiquimod 5% 3 times a week for anogenital warts.

• Commonest superficial fungal(dermatophytes) infection of the skin and hair of the scalp.
• Primarily affect prepubertal children.
• Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi which belong to 3 genera: T richophyton, Microsporum, and 
Epidermophyton.  
• Trichophyton Tonsurans is currently the most common cause of tinea capitis worldwide but 
Microsporum Canis  is the commonest in Asian countries.
• Ways of transmission: 
 ÊAnthropophilic- human
 ÊZoophilic - animal
 ÊGeophilic -soil
 ÊIndirectly through sharing fomites: hats, hairbrushes, etc
• Different clinical presentation may arise depending on the causative organism, the type of hair 
invasion, and the specific host inflammatory response. 
• Types of hair invasion:
1. endothrix- the fungus grows completely within the hair shaft and the hyphae are converted to 
arthroconidia (spores) within the hair while the cuticle surface of the hair remains intact.
2. ectothrix - the hyphae of the fungus destroy the hair cuticle and grow around the exterior of 
the hair shaft.
3. favus -The production of hyphae are parallel to the long axis of the hair shaft. When the hyphae 
degenerate, long tunnels are left within the hair shaft.
• Clinical presentations:
 ▪Various clinical manifestations found depending on the causative dermatophyte, the type of 
hair invasion, as well as the host inflammatory response. Fungal Infection:

1. Direct microscopic examination of skin scrapings and hair- strands of hairs including the roots 
and skin scrapings are mounted in 10%–20% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution onto a glass 
slide.  The slide is gently heated and microscopically examined for hyphae and spores. 
2. Fungal culture of hair and skin scrapings - Plucked hair fragments and skin scrapings are placed 
directly on a culture medium.
3. Wood’s lamp examination- When ectothrix dermatophytes e.g. Microsporum species are 
examined under a Wood’s lamp the scalp hair and skin show a bright yellow-green fluorescence.
• Treatment options:
 ÊAdvise against sharing personal belonging and maintain good hand hygiene.
 ÊSystemic antifungal treatment are the choice of treatment because topical antifungal agents do 
not penetrate down to the hair follicle root.
 ÊAdjunctive therapy: ketoconazole 2%, selenium sulphide 1% or ciclopirox 1% shampoo 3 times 
per week.
 ÊDosing for pediatric regimens for the treatment of tinea capitis:
• Kerion:
 Êan inflammatory fungal infection of the hair follicle of the scalp, characterized by boggy 
swelling, purulent discharge, alopecia, and lymphadenopathy.
 ÊMay result in residual scarring alopecia.
 ÊCould be mistaken as a bacterial infection.
 ÊTreatment option:
 ▪As per Tinea Capitis and may need to be extended. 
 ▪Antibiotic therapy is not recommended unless there is evidence of secondary bacterial 
infection due to trauma.
 ▪No role of surgical incision and drainage.
 ▪Use of oral steroids remains controversial and is not generally recommended as a routine 
care. 
• Follow up:
 ▪Repeat culture of skin scraping and plucked hair after 4 weeks
 ▪Continue treatment for another 2 weeks if follow-up culture result is positive.
 ▪Treatment could be discontinued once the culture result is negative. 
 ▪For patients who demonstrated no clinical improvement (lesion expanding in size, no regrowth 
of hair  and presence of  new lesion), consider increasing the dose of current agent or to extend

Infantile Haemangiomas (IH)
• IH are the most common benign vascular tumour of infancy. 
• Clinical course is marked by rapid growth during early infancy followed by slower growth, then gradual 
involution. (80% of IH size was reached during the early proliferative stage at a mean age of 3 months 
and 80% of IH completed the early proliferative growth phase by 5 months old).1
• A minority cause functional impairment and even more cause psychosocial distress. 
• Despite involution, some are left with residual skin changes (eg. thinned skin, scar, fibrofatty tissue and 
telangiectasias).
• Diagnosis can be made clinically. 
• Imaging of IHs is not indicated for diagnostic purposes unless the lesion has an atypical appearance 
or behaviour. 
• Imaging is indicated if there are ≥5 cutaneous IHs,(abdominal ultrasonography) or associated 
anatomic abnormalities are suspected (ultrasound or MRI of relevant structures).2
• IH can usually be classified as localized, segmental, indeterminate, and multifocal. 
• Clinical appearance of IH depends on the level(s) of the skin affected. 
• Superficial haemangiomas involve the superficial dermis and appear as bright red “strawberry” lesions, 
whereas deep haemangiomas involve the deep dermis and subcutis resulting in a tumor with a bluish 
colour. 
• Mixed haemangiomas, involve the dermis and subcutis and demonstrate clinical features of both types.3
Consult early (by 1 month of age) for lesions that are potentially high risk because of the following 
associations: 
 ▪potential for disfigurement (the most common reason treatment is needed); 
 ▪life-threatening complications; 
 ▪functional impairment; 
 ▪ulceration; and

permanent skin changes depending on anatomic 
location
Permanent changes in breast development
(e.g., breast asymmetry) or nipple contourTable 1: High-Risk IH2
• Most haemangiomas require no treatment. 
• Active non-intervention is recommended in order to recognize those that may require treatment 
quickly. 
• Treatment should be individualized depending on: 
• age of the patient, 
• size of the lesion(s), 
• location, 
• presence of complications and rate of growth or involution at the time of evaluation. 
• The potential risk(s) of treatment is carefully weighed against the potential benefits. 
• Educate caregivers of infants with an IH about the condition, including the expected natural history and 
its potential for causing complications or disfigurement.2
High risk haemangiomas (refer Table 1)
• High risk haemangiomas should be referred by primary care doctors for evaluation and treatment early 
(by 4 -6 weeks of life) and treatment should be started by paediatricians with experience in managing IH. Treatment

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 15       DERMATOLOGY• Starting dose of 1 mg/kg per day in 2 or 3 divided doses. 
• Increase to a target dose of 2 mg/kg per day (within 7 days) unless there are comorbidities (eg, PHACE 
syndrome) or adverse effects (eg,sleep disturbance, progressive IH ulceration) that necessitate a lower 
dose. 
• Can increase further to 3mg/kg per day if response inadequate.
*If PHACE syndrome patients who are at high risk of stroke require treatment with propranolol, use the 
lowest effective dose, slowly titrate the dose, and administer the drug 3 times daily. (to minimize abrupt 
changes in blood pressure)2
Duration:  Propranolol should be continued until 9 to 12 months old. Rebound growth during tapering or 
after stopping the medication may occur in 10% to 25% of patients and can occur even after 6 months of 
therapy. 
Patient education:  
• Propranolol be administered with or after feeding and that doses be held at times of diminished oral 
intake or vomiting to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
• Evaluate patients for and educate caregivers about potential adverse effects of propranolol, including 
sleep disturbances, bronchial irritation, and clinically symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension.2
Monitoring
• Routine ECG is not required.
• ECG screening only in the following children
1. in infants with a baseline heart rate below normal for age
2. in infants with a family history of congenital heart conditions or arrhythmias or with a maternal history 
of connective tissue disease
3. when there is a history of arrhythmia or one is auscultated during examination.2
• The majority of infants do not require any monitoring when starting propranolol. Patients younger then 4 
weeks of adjusted gestational age, pre-term infants, and those with feeding difficulties or other additional 
disorders need measurement of heart rate and blood pressure for 2 hours in hospital after the first dose, 
and if the dose is doubled or trebled.4
Other systemic therapy:
• Prednisone and prednisolone are second-line agents that may be used if there are contraindications to or 
an inadequate response to propranolol.
• Topical timolol may be prescribed for thin and/or superficial IHs.
• Intralesional steroids, surgery and laser therapy may be beneficial in selected IHs.2
Surgery
• The benefits and risks of surgery must be weighed carefully, since the scar may be worse than the results 
of spontaneous regression. 
• Surgery is especially good for small, pedunculated haemangiomas and occasionally, in cases where there 
may be functional impairment. It is usually used to repair residual cosmetic deformities. 
• Generally, it is recommended that a re-evaluation be done when the child is 4 years old, in order to assess 
the potential benefit of excision.6Oral propranolol is the first-line therapy

Section 15       DERMATOLOGYChapter 98:
Scabies
• Scabies is caused by the human itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. 
• The lifecycle of the sarcoptes lasts for 4-6 weeks. 
• Mites burrow into human skin and lay their eggs, which later hatch and grow into adults . 
• Any part of the body may be affected, and its transmission is by skin to skin contact.
• Topical treatment must be applied to the entire skin surface, from jawline downwards including all body 
folds, groin, navel and external genitalia, as well as the skin under the nails (especially crusted scabies). 
• At any time during treatment, medications should be re-applied if it is washed off i.e. after hand 
washing.
• Patients with scabies and their close physical contacts, even without symptoms, should receive 
treatment at the same time. Prescriptions must be provided for all household members. 
• After completion of treatment, patients should use fresh, clean bedding and clothing. If possible, 
potentially contaminated clothes and bedding should be washed at high temperature (>50°C) or kept in 
a plastic bag for up to 72 hours, because mites that are separated from the human host will die within 
this time period.
• Only allow the patient to go to school 24 hours after the start of treatment.Symptoms
• Intense generalised pruritus that is usually worse at night
• The pruritus is due to a delayed type-IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, and mite products (faeces 
and eggs)
• The main symptom takes 2 - 6 weeks to develop after primary infestation.
• History of itching in family members or close contacts concurrently or in the recent past 
Diagnosis
• Scrapings taken from burrows examined under light microscopy may reveal mites.
• A history of scabies in a family member or contact with scabies should be sought out specifically.
• Dermatoscopy and digital photography are non-invasive alternative methods for identifying the 
presence of scabies mites.Signs
• Characteristic burrow, which is a linear intra-epidermal tunnel produced by the moving mite. It appears 
as short wavy greyish/ white thread like elevations.
• Classic sites: interdigital folds, wrists, elbows, umbilical area, genital area and feet.
• In infants, burrows are common on the palms and soles, and sides of the feet. They can also be found 
on the heads of infants particularly post auricular folds.
• Nodular Scabies - papules or nodules seen at the site of mite infestation often affect the scrotum, 
axillae, back, or feet of children.
• Crusted or Norwegian Scabies - seen in young infants or immunosuppressed patients. Widespread mite 
infestation causes hyperkeratotic and/or crusted generalized rash.Introduction

Diagnosis and Management of Inborn Errors of Metabolism
• Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are biochemical genetic disorders that result from the deficiency of 
enzymes, membrane transporters, or other functional proteins.
• IEMs are individually rare but cumulatively common. 
• Children may present with acute overwhelming sickness or a prolonged, smouldering illness. For the 
former, rapid diagnosis is vital to limit morbidity and mortality. For the latter, diagnosis is important for 
the initiation of appropriate clinical care.
While the most recent international classification of IEM encompasses >1400 disorders, from a 
clinical point of view, all IEM can be classified into 3 groups from a clinical diagnostic perspective and a 
pathophysiological approach.  
1.  Small molecule disorders
2.  Disorders involving energy metabolism
3.  Complex molecule disorder• Neonates with unexplained sepsis-like appearance, overwhelming or progressive diseases without 
evidence of infection, particularly after normal pregnancy and birth.
• Recurrent episodes of vomiting, ataxia, seizures, lethargy, altered consciousness, particularly when 
preceded by vomiting, fever, infections or fasting.
• Patients with unexplained symptoms and signs of metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia or 
hypoglycaemia.
• Severe hypotonia.
• Severe global developmental delay, especially with loss of skills.
• History of being severely symptomatic and needing longer to recover with benign illnesses (e.g., upper 
respiratory tract infection).
• Unusual dietary preferences (e.g., protein or carbohydrate aversion).
• Subtle neurological or psychiatric abnormalities in older children or adolescents.
• Epileptic encephalopathy.
• Movement disorder (e.g., dystonia).
• Hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, liver failure, cholestatic jaundice.
• Dysmorphic syndromes (e.g., coarse facial features).
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
• Skin signs: ichthyosis, light sensitivity.
• Eye abnormalities - cataract, corneal opacities, pigmentary retinopathy.
• Chronic muscle weakness with pain.
• Renal stone disease in children.
• Renal tubular disease in children.
• An unusual smell from skin or urine: sweaty feet, burnt maple syrup, etc.
• Neuro-imaging abnormalities.Introduction

• Do not interfere with foetal development.
• Presents after a symptom-free interval (days to weeks).
• “Metabolic crisis” induced by food and catabolism.
• Most disorders are treatable.
• Most disorders have metabolic marker(s) & are detectable by:
• First line tests: blood glucose, blood ammonia, blood acid-base status, blood lactate, urine/ blood 
ketones.
• Second line tests: analysis of plasma amino acids (AA), urine organic acids (OA) and dried blood spot 
(DBS) acylcarnitine ± plasma total homocysteine. 
• Almost all disorders can be diagnosed by molecular genetic testing. Bloods can be taken first with 
DNA extracted and stored with consent in the event of an ill patient who may succumb before 
diagnostic results are out.

Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLIC• Most common cause of severe hyperammonaemia. 
• Clinical:  Severe neonatal onset form: rapidly progressive encephalopathy in the first days of life 
after a short symptom-free interval. Respiratory alkalosis is common early, but metabolic acidosis 
may mask it later if systemic shock develops. The initial presentation is often described as “sepsis-
like” but unlike neonatal sepsis, blood pressure is usually in the (high) normal range or even 
increased in the early stages of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. In some patients signs of 
acute liver failure, including coagulopathy, may be found. Late onset form: failure to thrive, feeding 
problems, vomiting, chronic/unexplained neurological symptoms, episodic encephalopathy with 
lethargy, ataxia, seizures, behavioural problems, protein aversion. Arginase deficiency differs from 
other UCD because patients rarely present in the neonatal period but manifests as progressive 
spastic paraplegia and developmental delay between 2 -4 years old, sometimes with episodic 
hyperammonaemia.  
• Diagnosis:  ↑↑ NH 4+, Plasma amino acid – abnormal profile, ↑urine orotic acid (identifies 
OTC deficiency and differentiates from NAGS/CPS1 deficiency).  Molecular genetic testing is 
recommended for definitive confirmation. 
Emergency management of acute hyperammonaemia: Rapid and efficient management is of utmost 
importance – short time-span from first symptoms to irreversible brain damage and death. The 
prognosis is considered very poor in patients with any of the following characteristics: 1. Coma >3 
days; 2. significantly elevated intracranial pressure; 3. Blood NH 4+ concentration in plasma >1000 
μmol/L.

• Give hypercaloric management.
• IV 10% (or higher) glucose with appropriate electrolytes (Na+, K+) at the rate according to 
patient’s age, at least: 
 Ê10 mg/kg/min in a neonate 
 Ê8 mg/kg/min in infants
 Ê6 mg/kg/min in all others
• Administration of lipids (1-2g/kg/d) or protein-free medical formula will provide additional 
energy and help promote anabolism. 
• In a neonate, aim to achieve 120 – 140 kcal/kg/day. In older infants or children, aim to achieve 
120 – 140% caloric requirement for age and sex. 
• Adjust volume according to individual demands and hydration status. Check glucose; add insulin 
if necessary.
• Effective antiemetic (Granisetron or ondansetron) to control vomiting.
Step 4: Detoxification 
• Pharmacotherapy: Remove NH 4+ using IV nitrogen scavengers (sodium benzoate and sodium 
phenylbutyrate) and replenish urea cycle intermediates (arginine, citrulline (CPS1 deficiency, 
OTC deficiency)).
• In undiagnosed patient in whom hyperammonaemia could be caused by either UCD (a.k.a Primary 
hyperammonaemia) or organic acidurias (a.k.a. secondary hyperammonaemia), consider to add 
carglumic acid (see section on organic acidurias).  
• Check blood NH 4+ after 2 hrs. Thereafter, it must be determined at least every 3 - 4 hours until the acute 
situation is successfully managed. 
• Reintroduction of protein/essential amino acids (oral or parenteral) must not be delayed for more than 
48 hours.
• If at any time during the crisis the blood NH 4+ escalates to >500 μmol/L or if the patient is 
encephalopathic (seizures, severely reduced consciousness or coma), continuous renal replacement 
therapy should be started as soon as possible.
• The method will depend on the experience of the local hospital but haemodiafiltration or haemodialysis 
have been proven most efficient while peritoneal dialysis with currently used solutions may be 
considered only if a more effective dialytic technique cannot be applied or for bridging to this more 
effective technique. Do not perform exchange transfusion. 
• Management to induce anabolism and infusion of nitrogen scavengers must be continued during and 
after completion of renal replacement therapy to prevent rebound hyperammonaemia. 
• When blood NH 4+ is persistently >1,000 µmol/L and prolonged coma evaluate whether to aim at all out 
treatment or to start palliative care.Drug*Loading dose over

• Oral sodium benzoate 250 - 500 mg/kg/day 
• Oral sodium or glycerol phenylbutyrate 250 - 500 mg/kg/day
• CPS1 or OTC deficiency: oral arginine or citrulline (preferred) 100-200 mg/kg/day. ASS or 
ASL deficiency: oral arginine 200 - 400 mg/kg/day
• Carglumic acid in individuals with NAGS deficiency and partially responsive CPS1 deficiency.
• Give vitamins and trace elements.
• Consider lactulose 
• Consider early liver transplantation, particularly in individuals with severe neonatal onset 
OTC and CPS1 deficiency.
• Monitor growth and laboratory values regularly (Target blood NH4+ <80 µmol/L, glutamine 
<1,000 µmol/L, glycine 100 - 150 µmol/L, arginine 80-150 µmol/L, essential amino acids 
should all be in the normal range)
• Acute decompensation: dietary indiscretion causes NH 4+ to increase but only rarely results 
in acute decompensation and encephalopathy. In contrast, infections and injuries trigger a 
large endogenous mobilization of muscle protein and can precipitate metabolic crisis and 
hospitalisation. 
• Treatment of intercurrent illness (with poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, fever): In order 
to prevent metabolic decompensation it is imperative to prepare & educate the parents/
caretakers to an individualized home-based sick day management plan. To interrupt the 
catabolism in its early stage:
• Stop protein intake (not more than 48 hours)
• Give sufficient fluid (water, juice, electrolyte solution) and extra calories (carbohydrates 
as glucose polymer) 
• If tolerated, special medical formula should be continued
• Reintroduce protein after 48 hours and increase stepwise until the amount of 
maintenance treatment is reached. E.g. one day ½ of the normal amount of protein, 
next day ¾, then full amount. (Prolongation of inadequately low protein intake increases 
the risk of protein catabolism.)
• Immediate hospital admission and check blood ammonia if the clinical condition 
deteriorates, oral intake is poor at home or the disease course is prolonged. 
• Administer caloric management that promotes anabolism even if blood ammonia is 
normal, until patient recovers.

Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLIC• Clinical:  (1) Severe neonatal onset form: progressive encephalopathy starting on 3rd-5th days of 
life, no abnormalities in routine laboratory tests except ketonuria. Hypoglycemia is rare. Odor of 
urine may be highly characteristic (maple syrup-like). Acute cerebral oedema is a well-recognized 
complication (fully reversible if treated early), may progress to cerebral herniation. (2) Attenuated 
forms (intermittent, intermediate): developmental delay, fluctuating/progressive neurological 
disease, recurrent ataxia, spastic diplegia, chronic vomiting with failure to thrive. 
• Diagnosis:  Plasma AA: elevation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) -↑↑↑Leucine (Leu, most 
neurotoxic), ↑lsoleucine (Ile), ↑Valine (Val). Presence of alloisoleucine is diagnostic. Urine OA: ↑ 
branched-chain oxo- and hydroxyacids, e. g. 2-OH-isovaleric acid, 2-oxoisocaproic acid. Molecular 
genetic test is recommended for definitive confirmation.ii. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) 
Step 1: Basic life support
• Ensure basic life functions (ventilator and circulatory support)  
Step 2: Stop the offending precursor nutrients
• Stop BCAAs/natural protein intake (for 24 to 72 hours)
Step 3: Promotion of anabolism
• Step (i) – Hypercaloric/anabolic nutritional support that contains iv 10% (or higher) glucose 
infusion, BCAA-free formula (enteral feeding via tube feeding + perfusor) and IV lipid (1-2 g/
kg/d) ± IV insulin (if persistent hyperglycemia or glucosuria) to enhance protein anabolism. 
Effective antiemetic (Granisetron or ondansetron) to control vomiting. Serial monitoring of 
blood BCAAs levels is essential. Step (ii) - Plasma concentrations of Val and Ile will normalize 
before Leu concentrations normalize. If Val and Ile fall below normal then it will become 
rate limiting for protein synthesis        avoid secondary deficiency of Ile and Val by early oral 
supplementation (each 100-300 mg/day); Step (iii) – Reintroduce Leu to the diet when plasma 
Leu drops to ≤ 400 μmol/L by adding natural protein e.g. breastmilk or infant formula. 
Step 4: Detoxification
• Promoting protein anabolism is key to reducing toxic levels of BCAAs. Reduction in leucine 
concentration at 750 µmol/L or more per 24 hrs is normally achievable with hypercaloric 
nutritional therapy. 
• However, in patients with very high concentrations of BCAAs or if nutritional therapy is 
insufficient, consider continuous renal replacement therapy (to reduce risk of cerebral 
herniation).
Step 5: Other supportive treatment
• Introduce supporting therapies, such as:
 ÊTreating infections
 ÊManaging seizures
 ÊManaging cerebral edema
• Long-term treatment:  
• Dietary restriction of BCAAs (especially leucine) by restricting natural protein (number of 
protein or Leu exchange is titrated to patient’s Leu tolerance) and use of BCAA-free medical 
formulas and low protein foods, and careful supplementation of isoleucine and valine (regular 
monitoring of plasma BCAAs); sufficient intake of essential nutrients & calories to promote 
normal growth.• Treatment:

Step 1: Basic life support
• Ensure basic life functions (ventilator and circulatory support)  
Step 2: Stop the offending precursor nutrients
• Transiently stop natural protein intake (24 – 48 hours)
Step 3: Promotion of anabolism
• Induce anabolism with IV 10% (or higher) glucose infusion and protein-free formula (enteral 
feeding via tube feeding + perfusor, IV lipids (1-2 g/kg/d) ± effective antiemetic (Granisetron or 
ondansetron) • Consider liver transplant in individuals with severe clinical phenotype (poor metabolic control, 
frequent metabolic decompensations).
• Early intervention of any intercurrent illness to prevent metabolic decompensation. Parents/
care taker should be educated to initiate sick day protocol upon the first signs of an illness: 
increasing BCAA-free medical formula intake to 120% of the usual intake, decreasing leucine 
intake by 50%–100%, and providing small but frequent feedings throughout a 24 hour period. 
Minor illnesses can be managed at home. Immediate hospital admission if poor oral intake, the 
clinical condition deteriorates or the disease course is prolonged or in serious cases.

utilization within the liver, myocardium, muscle, brain, and other tissues. 
• In general, cytoplasmic energy defects are generally less severe and more treatable than mitochondrial 
energy defects. 
• Diagnosis can be orientated by functional tests measuring glucose, lactate, ketones and other energetic 
molecules (AA, organic acids, acylcarnitines) in blood, CSF and urines and confirmed by enzyme assays 
and/or molecular genetic testing.
• Main disorders: GROUP 2: DISORDERS INVOLVING ENERGY METABOLISM
• Three main clinical presentations: 
 ÊLiver: hypoglycaemia, hepatomegaly, growth retardation (GSD Ia, Ib, VI. IX. Oa)
 ÊMuscle: exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, cardiomyopathy (GSD 0b, II, V, VIl)
 ÊMixed/generalized: cardiomyopathy, liver/muscle involvement (GSD III, IV, IX)
• Diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic test (preferred) or biopsy (histology) and enzyme 
studies (rarely done nowadays)
• GSD Ia and GSD Ib
 ÊMost severe type of hepatic GSD
 ÊClinical: First manifestation usually at the age of 3-6 months: recurrent hypoglycemia 3-4 hours

variant: same as above, plus neutropenia, leukocyte dysfunction, bacterial infections, diarrhea, 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
 ÊDiagnosis: ↓ Glucose, metabolic acidosis, ↑ lactate, severe lipemia, ↑ triglycerides, ↑ uric 
acid. Molecular genetic test
 ÊTreatment: Avoid hypoglycaemia through frequent carbohydrate intake: Frequent meals (every 
2 - 3 hours in infants, 4-hourly from childhood); slowly resorbed carbohydrates (uncooked corn-
starch), no sucrose, limited fructose and lactose/galactose (vegetables, fruits); soy-based milk 
replacement + calcium; multivitamins, vitamin D. Nights: continuous feeds (infants 12 hours, 
adults 8 - 10 hours) via nasogastric tube, start as soon as possible after last daytime meal; or 
4-hourly uncooked corn-starch. GSDIb: If neutropenia/infections, add Filgrastim (G-CSF). 
Consider Empagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor). 
 ÊMonitor: use noninvasive continual blood glucose monitoring device (keep preprandial blood 
glucose > 3.5 - 4.0 mmol/L); serum: normal creatinine, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, liver 
function tests; triglyceride concentration <6.0 mmol/l); body mass index between 0.0 and +

dysfunction. The first manifestation is frequently in late infancy, precipitated by fasting or infection 
with vomiting.
• Clinical: Severe deficiencies of the carnitine shuttle and long-chain fatty acid oxidation cause severe 
neonatal lactic acidosis, hyperammonaemia (esp. in Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocate (CACT) 
deficiency), hepatopathy, cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy, often lethal.
• Milder deficiency variants of long-chain fatty acid oxidation and the carnitine shuttle may manifest 
in adolescence or early adulthood as chronic muscle weakness, pain, or recurrent rhabdomyolysis 
(sometimes precipitated by exercise or infection) or cause acute or chronic cardiomyopathy.
• Other manifestations include retinopathy, often starting in infancy, and peripheral neuropathy.
• Diagnosis: DBS acylcarnitines analysis is usually diagnostic but may be normal when well. It is 
important to repeat when unwell. Urine organic acid and serum total/free carnitine may be helpful. 
Molecular genetic test for confirmation.
• Treatment: Avoid fasting, early intervention in intercurrent illness e.g. gastroenteritis, etc.
• Acute: high dose iv glucose (7 - 10 mg/kg/min). Do not give iv lipids.
• In proven disorders of long-chain fatty acid oxidation and the carnitine shuttle:
• Acute:  dialysis (rarely needed); medium-chain triglyceride via NG-tube or G-tube as slow continuous 
drip as needed
• Long-term:  restrict dietary long-chain fatty acids; Low-fat or medium-chain triglycerides rich 
medical formula; frequent meals, continuous nocturnal feeding; mixture of essential long-chain 
fatty acids (alpha-linoleic, linoleic); consider triheptanoin

Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLIC• Clinical: intellectual disability, speech impairment and epilepsy due to cerebral creatine deficiency. 
• Diagnosis: Low creatine concentrations in the brain can be recognized by MR spectroscopy; 
abnormal concentrations of creatine/creatinine and its precursor guanidinoacetate are usually 
found in serum and urine. Molecular genetic test for confirmation. 
• Treatment: Creatine 400 mg/kg/day
• Clinical: Severe forms: epileptic encephalopathy of infancy or early childhood, (secondary) 
microcephaly, psychomotor retardation. Milder variants: (exercise induced) fluctuating movement 
disorders (ataxia, spasticity, dystonia, chorea), childhood/juvenile/adult-onset absence epilepsy
• Diagnosis: CSF analysis (following a 4 - 6 hours fast): ↓ Glc < 2.7 mmol/I, CSF/blood Glc ratio <0.45 
(normal 0.65 ± 0.1), n-↓ lactate/alanine; molecular genetic test (SLC2A1 gene)
• Treatment: Ketogenic diet; avoidance of drugs that inhibit GLUT1 (e.g. barbiturates, chloral hydrate, 
diazepam, tricyclic antidepressants, ethanol, methylxanthines/green tea)
• Prognosis: Satisfactory with early treatment
• A heterogeneous group of inborn errors of oxidative phosphorylation/ mitochondrial energy 
production caused by pathogenic variants in several hundred different nuclear and mitochondrial 
DNA genes.
• Mutations in nuclear genes coding for respiratory enzyme complexes structural subunits and 
assembly factors or proteins needed for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance & replication or 
gene expression predominate in younger age group. 
• MtDNA mutations, often inherited in variable heteroplasmy (a situation where mutant and wild-
type mtDNA coexist within the same cell) levels from mother, are more frequently associated with 
specific clinical syndrome and may present at any age. 
• Heteroplasmy level may vary between cells, tissues, organs or different individuals carrying the 
same mtDNA mutation.
• A higher heteroplasmy (60% -80%) may lead to clinical symptoms while a low level of heteroplasmy 
may be clinically silent. E.g. For m.8993T>G and m.8993T>C pathogenic variants:  vi. Disorders of creatine biosynthesis or transport

• Young children frequently present with encephalomyopathic disease while myopathies 
predominate in older children. 
• Variable disease course: progressive, relatively static for long periods of time, or fluctuate with 
acute illness
Test Remarks
Blood lactate Measure on several occasions, elevated levels are a helpful clue, but normal 
levels do not exclude mitochondrial disease. Beware of artefactual elevation 
(struggling child, excessive squeezing); lactate may also be elevated in 
hypoxia, after seizure, and with certain drugs. 
CSF lactate May be elevated, particularly when there is CNS involvement, but normal 
levels do not exclude mitochondrial disease.
Plasma amino acids Elevated alanine may suggest a chronic/persistent elevation in blood lactate 
(May be the only clue in some patients with normal blood lactate) 
Urine organic acids Urine organic acid analysis may show Kreb’s cycle intermediates such as 
fumarate. In addition, it can show elevated lactic acid, ethylmalonic acid, 
3-methylglutaconic acid, MMA. Biochemical Screening Tests in Suspected Mitochondrial Disease

• Neuroradiological studies
 ÊThere are certain neuroradiological findings that are sensitive and quite suggestive in diagnosis 
of mitochondrial disease. MR spectroscopy may reveal lactate accumulation. CT brain may 
reveal symmetrical calcification, e.g. in basal ganglia. Four recognized MRI brain patterns are as 
follow: 
 ▪Leigh syndrome pattern
Characteristic brain MRI pattern of Leigh syndrome. (A) Axial T2 weighted images show 
important bilateral hyperintensities in the brainstem (white arrows). (B) Axial T2 weighted 
images show hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and thalami (black arrows). (C) Magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy shows a lactate peak at 1.33 parts per million (ppm) (white arrow). 
 ▪Stroke-like pattern
Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (left) and diffusion-weighted (right) MR brain images of a 
patient with MELAS showing the patchy abnormalities in multiple regions of the cortical tissue 
(not confined to a vascular territory). Acute changes may fluctuate, migrate, or even disappear 
completely during the acute to subacute phase. 
 ▪Leukodystrophy (frequently diffuse, patchy, or cystic/cavitating white matter lesions)
 ▪Cerebral or cerebellar atrophy (non-specific) or pontocerebellar hypoplasia (e.g. PCH6)

• The molecular genetic test has rapidly evolved to become the confirmatory test of choice for the 
definitive diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.
• Treatment: A multidisciplinary team is required to provide supportive care.
• General measures: 
 ÊEnsure adequate intake of calories, fluids and electrolytes; avoid fasting
 ÊAvoid/treat condition with high energy consumption: 
 ▪Treat fever efficiently. 
 ▪Treat seizures/epilepsy efficiently (avoid valproate) 
• Metabolic acidosis is common in PMDs. Types of acidosis: ketoacidosis (due to impaired 
β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation), lactic acidosis and renal tubular acidosis. Symptoms, signs with 
acidosis: mental state changes, hyperpnea, bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia, anorexia, 
vomiting, failure to thrive, delayed myelination, etc.
Acute treatment : 
 ÊCorrects metabolic acidosis with iv Sodium Bicarbonate. 
 ÊMonitor for hypernatremia and respiratory failure. 
 ÊMinimize dextrose to maintain euglycemia (High dextrose can cause increased elevation in 
lactate). 
Long term treatment : Consider ketogenic diet.
• Contraindicated drugs:
 ÊSodium valproate -Absolute contraindication in PMD caused by POLG mutations. In other PMDs, 
may be considered in exceptional circumstances.)
 ÊAminoglycosides – For short term, emergency use – the benefits outweigh the risks. For long 
term elective use – must exclude mtDNA mutations (m.1555A>G, m.1494C>T in MT-RNA1) that 
are associated with aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss. 
 ÊLactated Ringers (LR) - If Lactate < 5 mmol/L, LR is not contraindicated. If LR is deemed the most 
appropriate resuscitation fluid, benefit may outweigh risk for individual patientsMolecular Genetic Test Remarks
Targeted mtDNA 
genetic testing for point 
mutation and/or single 
large-scale deletionWhen the clinical presentation is typical, targeted genetic test allows 
confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. For example, testing for common mtDNA 
mutations for MELAS; single large scale deletion test for Kearns-Sayre 
syndrome. A negative blood result does not rule out the diagnosis because of 
tissue-dependent and age-dependent variation in heteroplasmy level (blood 
heteroplasmy level decreases significantly over time). It should be repeated on 
other tissues (that are clinically more severely affected and/or heteroplasmy 
level shows very little age-dependent variation) e.g. uroepithelial cells (urine 
sample), muscle, buccal mucosa cells, etc.
Targeted nuclear gene 
sequencingExample: Sequencing of POLG1 when clinical presentation (childhood onset
progressive encephalopathy, seizures, liver failure) is typical.
Targeted nuclear gene 
panelWhen there are findings indicating a particular condition that is genetically
heterogeneous. For example, mtDNA
depletion panel when mtDNA depletion syndrome is suspected. 
Whole exome/genome 
sequencing that 
includes mitochondrial 
genome sequencingThis is the most comprehensive approach. It not only allows diagnosis of a 
mitochondrial disorder but also other disorders that are in the differential 
diagnosis. However, there is a likelihood of finding more variants of unknown 
significance.Molecular Genetic Diagnostic Approaches for Mitochondrial Disease

 ÊMost risk attributable to the severity and extend of organ involvement such as cardiomyopathy, 
respiratory muscle weakness, bulbar dysfunction or severe lactic acidosis. Performs baseline 
comorbidities evaluation. 
 ÊFasting should be minimized and caloric and fluid intake maintained
 Êsmall intravenous boluses of propofol (avoid prolonged use as the maintenance of anaesthesia), 
benzodiazepines, or ketamine
• Stroke-like episode (SLE)
 ÊA subacute, evolving brain syndrome 
 ÊDiagnosis of a SLE requires the combination of clinical assessment, MRI and EEG (and other 
differential diagnoses excluded)
 ▪Clinical: headache, nausea and vomiting, complex visual symptoms including visual filed 
defects, encephalopathy, focal-onset seizures (with or without associated focal neurological 
deficits) including Epilepsia partialis continua, new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(excessive anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation or psychosis - SLE involve frontal, temporal or 
limbic lobe)
 ▪MRI brain: cortical and sub-cortical signal abnormalities not confined to vascular territories
 ▪EEG: focal epileptic discharges
 ÊGenetic aetiology: m.3243A>G (most common), POLG, other rarer mtDNA mutations
 ÊPossible pathophysiology mechanisms of SLE: i. mitochondrial angiopathy (impaired 
vasodilation due to reduced nitric oxide production); ii. mitochondrial cytopathy (causes 
cytotoxic edema due to ATP depletion, disrupted calcium homeostasis, etc  →neuronal 
hyperexcitibility →driver of SLE is seizure activity →neuronal death if untreated) 
 ÊTreatment: To treat the seizures/cytotoxic edema  - IV levetiracetam is recommended, but 
phenytoin (with cardiac monitoring) or phenobarbitone (with respiratory monitoring) can be 
used. Avoid valproate. To treat angiopathy  – IV arginine infusion 250 - 500 mg/kg over 60-90 
minutes given within 3 hours of symptom onset is recommended. May be given daily for up to 5 
days, May stop sooner if neurologic symptoms resolve.
• Although randomized, controlled trial data are lacking, supporting preclinical evidence and 
favourable benefit to-risk ratios justify empiric trial of vitamins and cofactors to support 
mitochondrial function in PMDs with further modification based on tolerability concerns or 
additional patient-specific genetic and/or clinical phenotypes.
• PMDs that are potentially treatable using specific therapies:
 ÊDisorders of Coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis – high dose of CoQ10 (30mg/kg/day)
 ÊLHON – idebenone 900mg/day (within 6 months, ideally as soon as possible from onset, 
maintains for at least 1 year or until a plateau in term of improvement is reached) Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLIC

• This expanding group encompasses diseases that disturb the metabolism of complex molecules that are 
neither water-soluble nor diffusible: sphingolipids (SPL), triglycerides (TG) phospholipids (PL), complex 
long chain fatty acids (LCFA), cholesterol and bile acids, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), oligosaccharides 
(OLS), glycoproteins, glycolipids and nucleic acids. 
• Metabolism of complex molecules take place in organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, 
endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) and most pathways involve several organelles and require 
transporters.
• Clinical symptoms are permanent, very often progressive, independent of intercurrent events, and 
unrelated to food intake. Most disorders do not present with acute crises.
• Catabolism or transport defects lead typically to storage of a visible compound like in classical LSD. 
• In general there is no antenatal manifestations although in some severe forms, this is possible such 
as hydrops or malformations. 
• Neurological presentations display progressive disorders with neurodegeneration with or without 
obvious visceral storage signs. 
• Diagnosis is mostly based on urine screening (mucopolysaccharides, oligosaccharides, etc.) and 
leukocytes enzyme analysis and/or molecular genetic testing. 
• Main disorders 
• Clinical: Affected children often appear normal at birth but subsequently develop chronic 
progressive disease symptoms and signs. Affected organ systems vary between diseases and include 
the skeletal system and connective tissue (dysostosis multiplex, growth failure, joints contractures, 
facial dysmorphism, hernias, etc.), the nervous system (progressive neurological abnormalities, 
developmental regression, etc.), sensory organs (corneal clouding, deafness), internal organs 
(hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomyopathy, etc.), and others. All MPS are autosomal recessive except 
Hunter disease (MPS II), which is X-linked.
• Diagnosis: Primarily by the analysis of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in urine; confirmation by 
leukocytes enzyme analysis and molecular genetic test. 
• Treatment: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for non-cerebral manifestations in MPS I, II, IVA, 
VI, and VIl. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is treatment of choice for severe MPS I to 
prevent cognitive decline (need to be performed before 2 yrs old). It can be used in MPS VI, but 
risks compared to ERT should be balanced; and controversial results in other MPS II. Otherwise, 
treatment is largely symptomatic.
• Clinical: Infantile-onset: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, hypotonia, respiratory 
failure, large tongue, failure to thrive, typical ECG (P waves, massive QRS wave and shortened PR 
interval), fatal in the first year if untreated. Late-onset: slowly progressive muscle weakness (only 
skeletal muscle), respiratory insufficiency. 
• Diagnosis: enzyme assay (α-glucosidase) in dried blood spots, molecular genetic test.

• Clinical: Sphingolipids are of special importance in the nervous tissue and reticuloendothelial 
system.  Most sphingolipidoses present with prominent neurological symptoms: developmental 
delay/regression, epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity. Hepatosplenomegaly and cherry-red macula spot 
are not uncommon. Dysmorphism (e.g. coarse facies) ± skeletal deformities (dysostosis multiplex) 
present in GM1 gangliosidosis). Skin angiokeratoma (Fabry disease). Radiologically distinct 
leukodystrophies are metachromatic leukodystrophy and Krabbe disease. Foam cells in the bone 
marrow or vacuolated lymphocytes. Due to overlapping clinical features, it is challenging to 
diagnose specific disease on clinical ground alone. 
• Diagnosis: ↑plasma chitotriosidase (in some), enzyme analyses in leukocytes or dried blood spots, 
and molecular genetic test 
• Treatment: Specific therapies are available for some conditions, e.g. ERT for non-neuropathic type 
of Gaucher disease. 
• Clinical: progressive neurological symptoms, epilepsy, developmental regression, Coarse facies, 
dysostosis multiplex (mild), angiokeratoma.  
• Diagnosis: urine oligosaccharides analysis, enzyme analyses in leukocytes or dried blood spots, and 
molecular genetic test 
• Treatment: symptomatic
• Clinical: combined clinical features of MPS and sphingolipidoses. 
• ML-II (a.k.a. i-cell disease) – Hurler-like but earlier, neonatal onset coarse facies, severe dysostosis 
multiplex
• ML-III – childhood onset, mild-to-moderate dysostosis multiplex, joint stiffness, coarse facies, etc.
• Diagnosis: ↑GAG, ↑multiple lysosomal enzymes in the plasma (due to failure in the transport of 
soluble lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi apparatus into the lysosome), molecular genetic test.
• Treatment: symptomatic 
• Clinical: epilepsy, cognitive and developmental regression, and loss of vision (retinal disease), 
specific EEG changes with photostimulation (CLN1)

• Defects of synthesis, recycling, intracellular transportation/trafficking of complex molecules. 
• No storage material. 
• May interfere with fetal development. 
• Most are irreversible disorders. 
• Many have multisystemic presentation. Almost all present as chronic or progressive diseases 
independent of food and intercurrent event. Most involve nervous system. 
• Only few have metabolic markers (peroxisome and cholesterol disorders)
• For all others the diagnosis is mostly based molecular genetic testing
• In general, there are no specific treatment with rare exception. 
• Main disorders:IIIb: Deficiency of Complex Molecules
• It is a large group of rare genetic disorders (~ 160 disorders) that affect the addition of sugar 
building blocks, called glycans, to proteins in cells throughout the body. 
• Clinical: It should be considered in any unexplained clinical condition particularly in multiorgan 
disease with neurological involvement but also in non-specific developmental disability. Many CDG 
interfere with neurodevelopment in the foetal life. 
• Diagnosis: Serum transferrin isoeletric focusing can be used for the screening of N-linked 
glycosylation defects. No biomarker for other types of CDG in which diagnosis is relies on molecular 
genetic test.  
• The most common CDG is Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2-CDG) : 
• Clinical: infancy: hypotonia, failure to thrive, dysmorphism: inverted nipples & unusual fat pads; 
multi-system disease (pericardial effusion, liver disease. coagulation defect, endocrine), severe 
cases fatal in infancy. 
• Late infancy - childhood: global developmental delay, severe cerebellar atrophy, ataxia, 
seizures, stroke-like episodes, retinitis, skeletal deformities, endocrine abnormalities (e.g. 
hypothyroidism, hypogonadism)
• Diagnosis: Serum transferrin isoelectric focusing -Type I pattern. Enzyme assay and molecular 
genetic test.
• Treatment: symptomatic
• A group of IEM affecting either the peroxisome biogenesis or a specific single enzyme involving the 
catabolism of very long chain, and branched chain fatty acids (phytanic acid), or complex molecule 
synthesis like bile acids or plasmalogens.
• Clinical: Many present at birth with a polymalformative syndrome, like Zellweger syndrome. Others 
present later between the 1st and 2nd decade of life with neurodegenerative disorders (Refsum 
disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, etc.) 
• Diagnosis: ↑plasmaVLCFA found in majority of peroxisomal disorders. Many other biomarkers.

synthesis and remodelling defects: a variety of progressive neurodegenerative symptoms, myopathy 
and cardiomyopathy (e.g. Barth syndrome), orthopedic signs (bone and chondrodysplasia, 
malformation), syndromic ichthyosis, and retinal dystrophy.
• Cholesterol and bile acid synthesis defects present either with polymalformative syndromes such 
as in Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome, neonatal cholestasis, or with late-onset neurodegenerative 
disorders such as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (treatable by chenodeoxycholic acid).
• Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) synthesis disorders should be suspected in patients with a combination 
of characteristic clinical features in more than one connective tissue: bone and cartilages (short long 
bones with or without scoliosis), ligaments (joint laxity/dislocations) and the subepithelium (skin, 
sclerae). Some produce distinct clinical syndromes with bone dysplasias.Zellweger syndrome:  neonatal presentation with severe hypotonia, seizures, liver dysfunction (severe 
jaundice, cholestasis), dysmorphic and skeletal abnormalities, sensorineural deafness, retinopathy, 
cataracts, failure to thrive; X-ray: stippling of the epiphyses; MRI: pachypolymicrogyria; fatal within a few 
months.
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy(ALD):  Most common peroxisomal disorder.
Clinical:  Childhood cerebral form: behavioural changes (e.g. ADHD), visual/hearing impairment, intellectual 
regression, ataxia, adrenal insufficiency, MRI brain -leukodystrophy predominantly involving the occipital 
lobe. Decerebration within 2 - 4 yrs. Adrenomyeloneuropathy (adolescent/young adult): progressive spastic 
paraparesis, sphincter problems, adrenal insufficiency. Addison disease only (childhood-adult): very rare. 
Diagnosis: ↑plasma VLCFA. Molecular genetic test.

malformation, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, and Hirschsprung disease.
• Vision: congenital cataracts (3%), glaucoma.
• Hypotonia and joint laxity.
• Feeding problems: usually resolves after a few weeks.
• Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (≤ 10%): usually resolves spontaneously but is 
associated with a 20-30% risk of AML.
• Pulmonary hypertension (1-5%).
• Congenital hypothyroidism (1-2%).
• Congenital dislocation of the hips.
• Craniofacial features: upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridge, 
protruding tongue, small low-set ears, nuchal folds, flat occiput. 
Infancy and 
Childhood• Developmental delay.
• Intellectual disability- mild to severe (IQ 30-70), language disorders.
• Autistic spectrum disorder.
• Behavioural problems: inattention, hyperactivity, maladaptive behaviour such as using 
social distraction to avoid a given task and stubbornness.
• Seizure disorder (6-8%).
• Recurrent respiratory infections (30-40%).
• Hearing loss (>70%): conductive [commonest due to otitis media with effusion], 
sensorineural, or mixed.
• Visual problems (60-80%):  strabismus (50%), cataract (3%), nystagmus (35%), 
glaucoma, refractive errors (70%), nasolacrimal duct occlusion.
• Obstructive sleep apnoea is common (30-60%): often multifactorial.
• Leukaemia (2-3%; relative risk: 15 to 20 times)
• Atlantoaxial instability (15%) – may result in spinal cord compression in 1-2% of cases. 
Symptoms of myelopathy/spinal cord compression include neck pain, changes in 
gait, unusual posturing of the head and neck (torticollis), loss of upper body strength, 
abnormal tendon reflexes, and changes in bowel/bladder functioning. 
• Hypothyroidism (10%). Prevalence increases with age.
• Short stature – usually multifactorial: congenital heart disease, sleep related upper 
airway obstruction, coeliac disease, nutritional inadequacy due to feeding problems 
and thyroid problems. Hormone deficiency may contribute to this.
• Over/underweight. About half of all DS are overweight by early childhood (3-8 years-
old) due to low resting metabolic rates.
• Dermatologic problems: seborrhoeic dermatitis, psoriasis.
• Moyamoya disease: an uncommon vascular abnormality with an increased incidence 
among patients with DS.

and 
Adulthood• Puberty: timing and stages of puberty comparable to other healthy girls and boys.
• In females, most ovulate and at least 50-70% are fertile.
• Males are usually infertile due to partial gondal dysfunction and impaired 
spermatogenesis.

Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLIC• Synonymous: Ovarian hypoplasia syndrome/ Monosomy X/ XO syndrome
• First described by Henri Turner in 1938.
• It is the most common sex chromosomal abnormality found in females
• TS results from a deletion or the non-functioning of one X chromosome in females. 50% of TS have 
monosomy X (45,XO) and the other 50% of the population has a mosaic chromosomal component (45,X 
with mosaicism).
• Girls with TS have short stature, and requires close monitoring of growth parameters. TS does not cause 
growth hormone deficiency but respond well to growth hormone therapy. Growth hormone treatment 
should be started once their height falls below 5% for age. Growth hormone therapy should continue 
until the patients reach their adult height and no longer have any growth potential. 
• Often have learning disabilities despite normal intelligence, may require special education and 
assessments at school.• Coarctation of aorta (CoA) and bicuspid aortic valve are associated with TS. The other common cardiac 
problem is prolonged QT intervals. An echocardiography, ECG and assessment by cardiologist is required 
at time of diagnosis. If CoA is present, it may require corrective surgery. Throughout life, patients’ need 
to be monitored annually for re-coarctation of aorta and aortic dilation.
• Blood pressure should be measured in the upper and lower extremities, there may discrepancy of 
upper and lower limb BP if CoA is present. Blood pressure should be maintained within the normal 
range to help decrease the risk of aortic dilation and dissection. Blood pressure should be controlled 
using beta-blockers as first-line, followed by ACE inhibitor. 
• QT-prolonging drugs (antiarrhythmics, macrolide and fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, some 
antifungals, and antiretrovirals, psychiatric medications) should be avoided. Incidence: 1 in 2000 to 1 in 2500 live female births, prevalence unknown because of underdiagnosis
The first step is a karyotype analysis with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. If TS is clinically suspected 
and the karyotype is negative, more cells should be analyzed on karyotype to exclude mosaic Turner. Introduction

collecting system malformations, positional/horseshoe kidney and malrotated kidneys
• Estrogen therapy - Almost all girls with Turner syndrome need estrogen, even if they have spontaneous 
puberty. Estrogen therapy should be initiated at around 11 to 12 years of age if gonadotropins are 
elevated or there is no development of secondary sexual characteristics. Later, cyclic progestins are 
added to the regimen to induce cyclic uterine bleeding and prevent endometrial hyperplasia. 
• Patients have an increased fractures because of low mineral density and osteoporosis. Their risk 
becomes lowered with estrogen therapy and supplemental vitamin D and calcium. TS also have risk for 
developing scoliosis, and need to be screened annually. Patients on growth hormone therapy may need 
more frequent screening for scoliosis. Monitor Vit D levels.
• Celiac disease – Tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibodies should be measured if there are 
symptoms.
• Metabolic syndrome –there is risk for developing central obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
dyslipidemia. HbA1c and lipid profile should be measured annually, beginning at ten years of age. 
• Gonadoblastoma – Patients with TS with marker chromosome elements on karyotype or patients who 
develop virilization, should be screened for the Y chromosome. If the Y chromosome is present, gonads 
should be removed, to prevent gonadoblastoma. Renal

Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLIC• PWS is an imprinting disorder where the Prader-Willi Critical Region on chromosome 15q11.2-q13 
demonstrates maternal-only imprinting (loss of paternal-only expressed genes).
• Hallmark features include severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy, followed by easy weight 
gain, then excessive eating and morbid obesity in early childhood unless externally controlled.
• Consensus diagnostic criteria for PWS have been developed by Holm et al. (PMID: 8424017)
*All patients tested positive via MS-MLPA, FISH, and microarray require a conventional karyotyping to 
detect chromosomal rearrangements that has implications for further parental testing and potential 
increased recurrence risk. 
DNA methylation studies and MS-MLPA detect up to 99% of PWS. 
Suggested testing strategy is MS-MLPA followed by microsatellite studies (for the non-deletion type) to 
distinguish between maternal UPD and imprinting defect.
Genetic counselling is recommended to detect occasional families with high recurrence risk and to 
investigate for PWS-like conditions following a negative PWS test.
A multidisciplinary approach is recommended.
Growth hormone deficiency
• Early treatment with growth hormone (GH) improves growth, development, body composition and 
cognition.
• There is evidence to support early treatment before the onset of obesity, including during infancy.
• Polysomnography should be performed prior to GH initiation and 6-12 monthly afterward.
Central hypothyroidism
• Annual thyroid function test, low threshold for treatment.
Central adrenal insufficiency
• Children with PWS may be unable to mount a stress response although baseline cortisol levels are 
normal.
• Consider checking early morning cortisol and prescribing stress dose steroids during significant illness, 
or before surgical procedures.
• Monitor for hypoglycemia particularly in infants.PRADER-WILLI SYNDROME (PWS)

• May need special feeding techniques e.g. orogastric tube feeding. 
• Avoid gastrostomy tubes (risk of gastric dilatation and necrosis).
• Early referral to the dietician, speech and occupational therapist is recommended.
Hyperphagia
• Close oversight of diet throughout life with a dietician familiar with PWS. (PWS clinic dieticians are 
contactable through HKL Dietetic Department)
• Monitor for food seeking and food stealing behaviours and suggest appropriate interventions 
Recommendations for Energy Intake:
• PWS patients only need about 60% of recommended daily allowance for age. 
• The RYG (Red, Yellow, Green) system is effective for weight management  in PWS patients
• For weight reduction, the recommendation is 7-9 kcal/cm height. 
• For weight maintenance, 10-11 kcal/cm height.
• For older children and adults, recommendation is 800-1100kcal/day.
Daily exercise is essential for calorie expenditure, physical and motor development, glycemic control and 
stress reduction. PWS patients are insensitive to thirst, water must be offered regularly. Use of non-nutritive 
sweeteners are discouraged as it will augment craving and preference for sweet things.
Sleep Apnea  
• Children with PWS are prone to sleep disordered breathing – central sleep apnea in infancy and 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS) in older children.
• Symptoms should be monitored at each visit, with low threshold to refer for polysomnography.
Temperature Dysregulation  
• Body temperature may not increase during infection and therefore antibiotic therapy should not be 
delayed if suspicion for infection is high.
• Advise appropriate clothing and additional fluid intake during outdoor activities/sports 
Scoliosis  
• Monitor from infancy. Do not sit children upright until they are able to pull to sit on their own.
• Not a contraindication for treatment with growth hormone.
Patient support groups such as the PWS association can support families with PWS children. Introduction to 
such groups is recommended following diagnosis.Hypogonadism
• Consider a trial of HCG for undescended testes.
• If testes do not descend by 18 months old, surgery is recommended. 
• Consider cautious titration of gonadal steroid replacement to initiate secondary sexual characteristics 
during adolescence.
• Males are usually infertile. Females may be potentially fertile and the recurrence risk needs to be 
explored.
Type II diabetes mellitus 
• To screen annually especially in obese PWS patients and treat as necessary. 
Osteoporosis 
• Bone density can be monitored by age of puberty (~ 14 years old).
• Ensure adequate nutritional intake of calcium/vitamin D and physical activities.

Section 16       GENETIC AND METABOLICMarfan syndrome (MFS) results from an autosomal dominant mutation of the gene fibrillin-1 (FBN1) which 
is the main component of microfibrils, resulting in numerous possible deformities and defects involving 
the connective tissue. 75% cases are inherited from either of the parents and hence the importance of 
examining parents and siblings if necessary.
Manifestations vary widely, but the principal structural defects involve the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal 
and ocular systems, causing a typical constellation of long limbs, aortic root dilation, and dislocated lenses.
Diagnose using revised Ghent criteria (see appendix, also available at Marfan Foundation); genetic testing 
is recommended for confirmation of diagnosis. Echocardiogram should include measurement at the aortic 
root at the sinus of Valsalva and the z-score calculated according to age, gender and BSA (https://marfan.
org/dx/zscore-children/).
1. All patients should routinely be given beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol) to help prevent 
cardiovascular complications. These drugs lower myocardial contractility and pulse pressure and reduce 
progression of aortic root dilatation and risk of dissection. Angiotensin II receptor blockers also may be 
given. Aortic dissection is the most dangerous complication.
2. Prophylactic surgery is offered if aortic diameter is > 5 cm (may be less in children).
3. Severe valve regurgitation is surgically repaired.
4. Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis before invasive procedures is not indicated except in patients who 
have prosthetic valves or who previously had infective endocarditis.
5. Scoliosis is managed with bracing as long as possible, but surgical intervention is encouraged in patients 
with curves of 40 to 50°.
6. Cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular findings (including echocardiography) should be reevaluated 
annually.
7. Appropriate genetic counseling is indicated
8. Prognosis 
1. Family history: Yes/No
2. Aortic dissection: Yes/No
3. Aortic diameter: Z score :
4. Systemic features score:Advancements in therapy and regular monitoring have improved quality of life and reduced mortality. 
Median life expectancy increased from 48 years in 1972 to near normal in people receiving appropriate 
medical care. However, life expectancy is still reduced for the average patient, primarily because of the 
cardiac and vascular complications. MARFAN SYNDROME

Investigating Children Suspected Of Having A Condition With 
Genetic Basis 
• Our understanding of the genetic aetiologies of many paediatric disorders has grown substantially in 
recent years
• Genetic diseases could be due to 
 ÊChromosomal abnormalities  which include numerical abnormalities (aneuploidy) and structural 
abnormalities (deletion, duplication, insertion, inversion, and translocation). Numerical 
abnormalities and large structural abnormalities are detectable by conventional karyotyping. 
Detection of small structural abnormalities such as microdeletion and microduplication (a.k.a. 
copy number variations (CNV) ) require molecular tools and techniques e.g. fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), Multiple Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), Chromosomal 
Microarray Analysis (CMA, either single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array or array comparative 
genomic hybridization (aCGH)) or using software tools to infer CNV from data generated from Next 
generation sequencing (NGS)-based tests (targeted gene panels, whole exome sequencing (WES), 
and whole genome sequencing (WGS)). 
 ÊPathogenic DNA sequence variants in single genes , detectable by DNA sequencing. 
 ÊNucleotide repeat expansion , e.g. congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, myotonia 
dystrophy. 
 ÊEpigenetic changes (such as genomic imprinting) , e.g. Angelman’s syndrome, Prader-Willi 
syndrome.
 ÊMitochondrial genome abnormalities.   
• Choosing an appropriate genetic test is a multi-factorial consideration: clinical phenotype, availability of 
the tests, financial resource. etc. Consult the Clinical Genetics/Metabolic team if indicated. 
• “Genetic first” approach with early genome-wide analyses such as whole exome sequencing (WES) 
or whole genome sequencing (WGS) may be easier, more cost-effective and potentially more rapid in 
arriving at a definitive diagnosis than a combination of several biochemistry screening tests that have a 
limited sensitivity and specificity.

• If a child dies of an unknown, possible genetic disease, it is essential to collect representative post-
mortem samples and discuss their analysis with Clinical Genetics/Metabolic team. Without diagnosis, 
genetic counselling of the parents and reliable risk assessment for future children is not possible. 
• Samples/investigations:
• Mandatory
 ÊSave a blood sample for potential genetic testing
 ÊOption 1: Save 5 mls whole blood in EDTA bottle (pink top). Send it immediately (at room 
temperature) to genetic laboratory for DNA extraction and storage. If the transport is not 
immediately available, keep the blood in a refrigerator (4oC, maximum storage duration: not more 
than 4 weeks). For longer storage (months to years), blood sample should be stored in a freezer at 
-20oC to -80oC and remain there until they can be shipped to the laboratory
 ÊOption 2: Keep and store a dried blood spots specimen (spotted onto an appropriate filter paper 
card)
 ÊBasic IEM tests: plasma amino acid, urine organic acid, DBS acylcarnitines. (If possible, collect the 
blood and urine samples prior to expected death. Autolysis during the process of dying causes 
intracellular fluid to mix with extracellular fluid. This may lead to misleading changes of metabolites 
concentration). 
• Consider
 ÊCSF (freeze immediately, if possible at -80oC)
 ÊBile (spot on filter paper for acylcarnitines analysis)
 ÊSkin biopsy (store at ambient temperature in culture medium, send for fibroblast culture. DO NOT 
FREEZE)
 ÊFine needle biopsy of muscle, heart, liver.
• High risk scenario includes: 
• A previous child in the family has had an IEM.
• Multiple unexplained early neonatal death.
• Mother has HELLP/fatty liver disease during pregnancy 
(HELLP – Haemolytic Anaemia, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets).
• Consider to transfer the expected newborn in utero or soon after delivery to a centre with facilities to 
diagnose and manage IEM.
• If potential/index patient diagnosis is known: screens for the specific condition, e.g. urea cycle disorders 
– monitor ammonia and plasma amino acid, MSUD – monitor plasma leucine (amino acids).
• If potential/index patient diagnosis is unknown: Collect dried blood spots for acylcarnitine profile, 
plasma amino acid and urine organic acid on 2nd or 3rd day after feeding, send it immediately and get 
result as soon as possible. 
• Other essential laboratory monitoring may include: blood NH4+, VBG, blood glucose. Please discuss 
with metabolic team.
• To prevent decompensation before the disease status of the newborn is known: 
 Êprovide enough calories (oral/IV)
 Êdietary protein restriction may be necessary especially if index case presented very early (before 
1 week). Protein-free formula should be given initially and small amount of natural protein (e.g. 
breast milk) can be introduced gradually after 48 hours depending on baby’s clinical status. 
• If the index patient presented after the first week, the newborn should be given the minimum safe level 
of protein intake from birth (approximately 1.5 g/kg/day). Breast feeding should be allowed under these 
circumstances with top-up feeds of a low protein formula to minimise catabolism. 
• Get the metabolic tests result as soon as possible to decide whether the baby is affected or not.Post-mortem investigations

Appendicitis
• Appendicitis is the most common surgical condition of the abdomen in children over the age of 4 years 
and yet can be a challenge to diagnose and manage. 
• Although diagnosis and treatment have improved over the years, it continues to cause considerable 
morbidity and even mortality in Malaysia.
• The mortalities appear to be due to delay in diagnosis, causing consequences of inadequate 
perioperative fluid resuscitation, and replacement, delay in IV antibiotics commencement for sepsis.
• Abdominal pain – Lower abdominal pain is an early and almost invariable feature. 
• Usually the pain starts in the epigastrium or periumbilical region before localising to the lower abdomen 
or the right iliac fossa(migratory pain).
• However the younger child may not be able to localise the pain. 
• If there is collection in perforated appendicitis, the abdominal pain is generalised.
• Nausea and vomiting occurs in about 90% of children and is an early symptom.
• Most children have a loss of appetite. A hungry child rarely has appendicitis.
• Diarrhoea is more common in the younger age group causing confusion with gastroenteritis. 
• It can also be due to pelvic appendicitis or collection of pus within the pelvis.
• Dysuria and frequency are also commonly present in the child with pelvic appendicitis or perforated 
appendicitis.
• Fever is usually low grade for acute appendicitis, but becomes > 380C when the appendix has 
perforated.
• General – the child is usually lethargic and may be dehydrated.
• Dehydration must be actively sought for especially in the obese child and the child with perforated 
appendicitis. 
• Clinical assessment for dehydration e.g.; tachycardia, delayed capillary refill time, poor urine output, 
feeble pulse. 
• Tenderness on palpation is essential for the diagnosis. It may be localised to the right iliac fossa or be 
generalised. The tenderness may also be mild initially and difficult to elicit in the obese child or if the 
appendix is at retrocaecal region. 
• Eliciting rebound tenderness is usually not required to make the diagnosis and can cause unnecessary 
discomfort.
• Guarding signifies peritonitis but may be subtle especially if the child is toxic, obese and very 
dehydrated.
• Rectal examination is only required if other diagnoses are suspected e.g. ovarian or adnexal pathology 
in female patient.Clinical Features

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 17       PAEDIATRIC SURGERY• Full blood count – The total white blood cell count may be elevated but a normal count does not 
exclude appendicitis.
• Blood Urea and Serum Electrolytes – Raised urea level with normal creatinine. Electrolytes imbalance.
• Serum Amylase – If pancreatitis cannot be ruled out as the cause of the abdominal pain.
• Ultrasound is commonly performed. It increases accuracy of diagnosis and can rule out other causes of 
pain but is dependent on the operator, patient habitus and cooperation.
• CT scan with IV contrast is considered in selective cases only when dilemma in diagnosis is encountered. 
It carries a high degree of diagnostic accuracy but is associated with high radiation risks and costs. It 
should only be done after adequate fluid resuscitation to avoid nephropathy. 
• Therefore, the recommendation is that the child is assessed by a surgeon or a paediatrician 
preoperatively before imaging.
• If the diagnosis cannot be made with certainty, especially in preschool age, or the child is very ill 
and there are no facilities or personnel for intensive care, the child must be referred to the nearest 
paediatric surgical unit with commencement of fluid resuscitation, stabilisation and IV antibiotics prior 
to transfer. 
• Perforation can occur within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms.
• Perforation rate increases with the duration of symptoms and delayed presentation is an important 
factor in determining perforation rate.
• Perforation rate: Adolescent age group - 30-40%
• In younger child - up to about 70%.
• If unsure of the diagnosis, active observation with adequate fluid resuscitation can be done. 
• Antibiotics are to be started once the diagnosis is made. This has not been shown to increase the 
morbidity or mortality.
• Delaying surgery till daytime, while resuscitating and giving antibiotics also does not significantly affect 
the perforation rate, complications or operating time. 
• Appendicular abscess or mass may be treated with IV antibiotics to settle the inflammatory and 
infectious process. 
• If the child settles, this can then be followed by an interval appendicectomy, done within 6 weeks of the 
original disease. 
• A repeated ultrasound is recommended prior to surgery to reassess the lesion. Investigations

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 17       PAEDIATRIC SURGERY• Children with appendicitis (suspected or confirmed) should be reviewed by a specialist.
• Dehydration should be actively looked for. 
• The heart rate, blood pressure, perfusion and the urine output should be closely monitored.
• The blood pressure is usually maintained in the children until they have decompensated.
• Rehydration must be aggressive, using 20 mls/kg aliquots of normal saline or Hartmann’s solution 
(Ringer’s lactate) given fast over ½ - 2 hours.
• The child should be reviewed after each bolus and the rehydration continued until the child’s heart rate, 
perfusion urine output and electrolytes are within normal limits. 
• Using normal or half saline + 5% D/W as maintenance fluid, to add KCl in drip once acute renal failure is 
ruled out. 
• Antibiotics should be started soon after the diagnosis is made.
• Non-operative management of UNCOMPLICATED appendicitis can be considered in centres with 
paediatric surgical expertise with selective criteria, such as confirmation of diagnosis by ultrasound with 
absent of appendicolith, patient is reasonably well and responding to antibiotics. 
• Frequent assessment is mandatory. Surgery should be considered when symptoms persist 24-48 hours 
later after commencement of IV antibiotics. 
• Presence of appendicolith is not recommended for non-operative management as it carries a high 
recurrent rate, up to 75%. 
• However, operation is recommended in the child with perforated appendicitis.
• Inotropes may need to be started early if the child is in severe sepsis.
• Operation - There is no rush to take the child to the operating theatre. Fluid resuscitation is crucial. It 
is recommended that appendicectomies not be performed late at night (after 10pm), especially in the 
sick child. However, the time should be utilised to continue the resuscitation and antibiotics with close 
monitoring of the child.
• Surgery can be laparoscopic or open appendicectomy.
• At surgery, a peritoneal swab C+S is usually sent for child at extreme age, i.e. below 4 years old, in the 
presence of pus in peritoneal cavity. 
• Pus must be fully evacuated before closing the abdomen. 
• No drain is required and the skin can be closed with a subcuticular suture.Management

 ÊSlow (rapid rehydration will cause cerebral oedema) unless the child is in shock
 ÊFluid
 ͳ0.45% saline + 10%D/W (+ 5-10 mmol KCl/kg/day once the child has passed urine).
 ͳRate (mls/hr) = [Maintenance (150 ml/kg body weight) + 5-10 % dehydration {% dehydration x

 ͳReplace gastric losses with normal saline.
 ͳDo NOT give Hartmann’s solution (the lactate will be converted to bicarbonate which worsens 
the alkalosis)
 ÊInsert a nasogastric tube – free flow.
 ÊComfort glucose feeds maybe given during the rehydration period but the nasogastric tube needs to 
be left on free drainage.
• Pyloromyotomy after the electrolytes have been corrected.
MALROTATION OF THE MIDGUT
A term that embraces a number of different types of abnormal rotation that takes place when the bowel 
returns into the intra-abdominal cavity in utero. This is important because of the propensity for volvulus of 
the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery causing vascular compromise of most of the small bowel.
Types of Clinical Presentation
Acute Volvulus
• Sudden onset of bilious/ non-bilious vomiting in a previously well child.
• Abdominal distention with/without a mass (late sign).
• Bleeding per rectum (late sign).
• Ill baby with distended, tender abdomen.
Chronic Volvulus
• Caused by intermittent or partial volvulus resulting in lymphatic and vascular obstruction.
• Recurrent colicky abdominal pain.
• Vomiting (usually bilious).
• Malabsorption.
• Failure to thrive.
Investigations
• Plain Abdominal X-ray

Intussusception
• Intussusception is the invagination of one portion of intestine into another with 80% involving the 
ileocaecal junction. 
• Early diagnosis and prompt fluid resuscitation reduces the morbidity rate and successful rate for non-
surgical intervention.
• The incidence starts at 6 months of age, with the peak age group being 2 to 4 years.
• Majority of the children in this age group have no pathological lead point. 
• Lymphoid hyperplasia has been linked. 
• Children may also have a preceding viral illness.
Common lead points (usually in the age group outside the above):
• Structural – Meckel’s diverticulum, duplication cysts.
• Neoplastic – Lymphoma, polyps, vascular malformations.
• Vascular – Henoch-Schonlein purpura, leukaemia.
• Miscellaneous – Foreign body.
• Previously healthy or preceding viral illness.
• Pain - Sudden onset, severe intermittent cramping pain lasting seconds to minutes.
• During the time in-between attacks lasting between 5 to 30 minutes, the child may be well or quiet.
• Vomiting – Early reflex vomiting consists of undigested food but if the child presents late, the vomiting is 
bilious due to obstruction.
• Stools- Initially normal, then become dark red and mucoid (“red currant jelly”).
• Note that small bowel intussusception may have an atypical presentation.
• Well- looking/drowsy/dehydrated/fitting (due to hyponatremia) depending on the stage of 
presentation.
• Abdominal mass (sausage shaped but may be difficult to palpate in a distended abdomen).
• Abdominal distension is a late sign.
• Plain abdominal X-ray – paucity of bowel gas on the right side with loss of visualization of the lower

• The sedated child can also be placed in a Trendelenburg position for an hour to see if the hernia will 
reduce spontaneously.
• If the manual reduction is successful, herniotomy is performed 24-48 hours later when the oedema 
subsides. 
• If the reduction is not successful,the operation is performed immediately.Presentation

Undescended Testis
• An empty scrotum may be due to the testis being undescended, ectopic, retractile or absent.
• Familial predisposition present in 15%. 10 - 25% are bilateral.
• At birth: Full term 3.4%
Premature 30.3%
• At 1 year:Full term 0.8%
Premature 0.8%
• Adult 0.7-1%
• Spontaneous descent may occur within the 1st year of life after which descent is rare.
• Trauma (especially if in inguinal canal).
• Torsion - extravaginal type.
• Decreased spermatogenesis. Damage occurs in the first 6-12 months of life. 90% of patients with 
orchidopexy before 2 years have satisfactory spermatogenesis. If done after >15 years old, fertility is 
15%. Fertility isalso affected by ductal anomalies.
• Testicular tumour: Risk is 22 times higher than the normal population (Intra-abdominal 6 times more 
than inguinal). Surgery makes the testis more accessible to palpation and thus an earlier diagnosis.
• Associated hernias (up to 65%), urinary tract anomaly (3%, e.g. duplex, horseshoe), anomalies of 
epididymis or vas deferens and intersex problems.
• Psychological problems.
• Ask caretaker whether testis was ever felt in the scrotum, more easily felt during a warm bath and when 
squatting.
• Examine patient (older children can be asked to squat). 
• A normal sized scrotum may suggest a retractile testis. 
 ÊA retractile testis, once brought down to the scrotum, can stay in the scrotum transiently. 
 ÊSurgery is usually not required for the retractile testis.
• The scrotum tends to be hypoplastic in true cryptorchidism.
• If bilateral need to rule out dysmorphic syndromes, hypopituitarism, and chromosomal abnormalities 
(e.g. Klinefelter). Exclude intersex disorders.
• Observe the child for the 1st year of life. 
 ÊIf the testis remains undescended after 1 year of life surgery is indicated. 
• Surgery should be done between 6-18 months of age. 
• Results of hormonal therapy (HCG,LH-RH) have not been good. 
• However, the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone as an adjuvant to orchidopexy appears to possibly 
improve germ cell maturation in child with bilateral non palpable testes.
• A non-palpable testis may represent an inguinal testis that is difficult to palpate, an intra-abdominal 
testis, a vanishing testis or true tesiticular agenesis.
• For bilateral impalpable testis: Management of choice is Laparoscopy ± open surgery.
• Ultrasound, CT scan or MRI to locate the testes have not been shown to be useful. 
• Check chromosomes and 17 OH progesterone levels if genitalia are ambiguous.Incidence

• Incarcerated inguinal hernia.
• Idiopathic scrotal oedema.
• Acute hydrocele.
• Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
• Tumours.
• Trauma.
• Scrotal (Fournier’s) gangrene.
• Symptomatic varicocele.
• Sudden severe pain (scrotum and referred pain lower abdomen/inguinal for cryptoorchidism )
• Nausea and vomiting
• No fever or urinary tract infection symptoms until later
• Involved testis - high, tender, swollen. (depending on location - inguinal, abdomen for cryptoorchidism)
• Spermatic cord – swollen, shortened and tender.
• palpable testis - abnormal lie, usually transverse.
• Loss of cremasteric reflex
• Less painful
• Hard in consistency
• same as early presentation
However, reactive hydrocele and scrotal oedema make it difficult to examine.• Torsion of the testis is an emergency as failure to detort testis within 6 hours will lead to testicular 
necrosis.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 17       PAEDIATRIC SURGERYExtravaginal
• The torsion usually occurs in the perinatal period or during infancy and is thought to be probably due to 
an undescended testis.
Intravaginal
• This is due to a high investment of tunica vaginalis causing a “bell-clapper” deformity.
• It usually occurs in boys between 10-14 years old.
• The deformity is usually bilateral.
Investigation
• Urinalysis - normal
• Colour Doppler Ultrasonography - 85% sensitivity and 100% specificity looking for intratesticular arterial 
blood flow and spiral twisting of the spermatic cord. 
• Highly operator dependent. However, edema may affect the findings.
Management
• High index of suspicious warrants a surgical exploration immediately without colour doppler 
ultrasonography. 
• Exploration: salvage rate: 83% if explored within 5 hours; 20% if explored after 10 hours.
• If the testis is viable, bilateral orchidopexy after detorsion is done.
• If the testis is not viable, then an ipsilateral orchiectomy and a contralateral orchidopexy needs to be 
done.There are 2 types of torsion:

Importance: May be confused with torsion of testis.
Can occur at any age.
Route of infection
• Reflux of infected urine
• Blood borne secondary to other sites
• Mumps
• Sexually transmitted infection
Symptoms
• Gradual onset of pain with fever.
• May have a history of mumps.
• ± Dysuria/ frequency.
• post-pubertal - urethal discharge
Physical examination
• Testis may be normal with a reactive hydrocoele.
• Epididymal structures are tender and swollen.
Investigation
• Urinalysis and urine culture
• Colour doppler ultrasonography - TRO testicular torsion. Increased vascularity of the testis and 
epididymis. 
• Investigate for underlying structural anomalies of the urinary tract and
• voiding dysfunction for recurrent episodes - USG KUB , MCUG
• Rule out sexual abuse
Treatment
• If unsure of diagnosis, explore.
• Treat infection with antibiotics.Symptoms
• Age – 8-10 years old.
• Sudden onset of pain, mild initially but gradually increases in intensity.
Physical Examination
Early
• Minimal redness of scrotum with a normal non-tender testis.
• Tender nodule “blue spot” (upper pole of testis) is pathognomonic.
Late
• Reactive hydrocele with scrotal oedema makes palpation of testis difficult.
Investigation
• Usually not needed. 
• Colour Doppler Ultrasonography may show increased blood flow to the epididymis or testis leading to 
misdiagnosis of acute epididymitis or epididymoorchitis. 
Treatment
• If sure of diagnosis of torsion appendages of testis, the child can be given the option of non-operative 
management with analgesia and bed rest.
• If unsure of diagnosis, explore and remove the twisted appendage (this ensures a faster recovery of 
pain too!).TORSION OF APPENDAGES OF TESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS

• Tracheo-oesophageal fistula: Reflux of gastric contents, difficult to ventilate.
• Distal obstruction: If present and the baby is ventilated, prone for bowel perforation.
• Prematurity, and congenital heart disease: If present, associated with higher morbidity and mortality.
• Evaluate the type of oesophageal atresia with/without fistula and associated anomalies e.g. 
penumonia, cardiac, chromosomal, duodenal and intestinal atresias, anorectal anomalies.
• Suction of the upper oesophageal pouch: A sump suction tube (“Replogle©”) should be inserted and 
continuous low pressure suction done. 
• Otherwise frequent intermittent (every 10-15 mins) suction of the oesophageal pouch and oropharnyx 
is done. 
• This is continued even during transport of the baby, to prevent aspiration pneumonia. 
• Maintain good oxygenation. Mechanical ventilation only if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY .
• Fluids - Maintenance and resuscitation fluids as required.
• Position - Lie the baby horizontal and lateral or prone to minimise aspiration of saliva and gastric 
contents
• Monitoring – Pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory monitoring.
• Keep baby warm.

• Babies with sufficient respiratory effort may be monitored closely with minimal supplemental oxygen.
• Evaluation for associated anomalies and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).
• Ventilation: Direct endotracheal intubation and ventilation without face mask- bag ventilation is 
required for those with significant respiratory distress at delivery and pre transport. Low ventilatory 
pressures are to be used to prevent pneumothorax. A contralateral pneumothorax or PPHN need to be 
considered if the child deteriorates. If the baby is unstable or high ventilatory settings are required, the 
baby should not be transported.
• Frequent consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric surgeon to decide when to transport the baby.
• Chest tube: If inserted, it should not be clamped during the journey.
• Orogastric Tube: Gastric decompression is essential here. A Size 8 Fr tube is inserted, aspirated 4 hourly 
and placed on free drainage.
• Fluids: Intravenous fluid management is critical and based on blood glucose and hydration state. Fluid 
overload must be avoided.
• May need inotropic support and other modalities to optimize outcome.

Section 17       PAEDIATRIC SURGERY• Evaluation: for hydration and associated syndromes and anomalies.
• Fluids: IV fluids are essential as losses are tremendous especially from the exposed bowel. Boluses 
(10-20 mls/kg) of normal saline, Sterofundin or colloids must be given frequently to keep up with the 
ongoing losses.
• A maintenance drip of ½ Saline + 10% D/W at 60 – 90 mls/kg (Day 1 of life) should also be given.
• Orogastric tube: Gastric decompression is essential here and a Size 8-10Fr tube is inserted, aspirated 4 
hourly and placed on free drainage.
• Warmth: Pay particular attention to the temperature control. The increased exposed surface area and 
the fluid exudation will cause the baby to be wet and cold. Wrapping the baby’s limbs with cotton and 
plastic will help.
• Care of the exposed membranes: The bowel/membranes should be wrapped with a clean non 
permeable sheath e.g;  plastic film, without compressing, twisting and kinking the bowel. Please do 
NOT use “warm, saline soaked gauze” directly on the bowel as the gauze will get cold and stick to the 
bowel/membranes.
• Disposable diapers or cloth nappies changed frequently will help to keep the child dry.
• Monitoring: Heart rate, Capillary refill time, Urine output (the baby may need to be catheterised to 
monitor urine output or have the nappies weighed).
• Position: To position the bowel at the center of abdomen and supported by a ‘doughnut’ (cotton in a 
stockinette) after wrapping the bowel with non permeable sheath.
• Referral to the paediatric surgeon as soon as possible.Management• Exomphalos and Gastroschisis are the more common abdominal wall defects.
• Gastroschisis: Defect in the anterior abdominal wall of 2-3 cm diameter usually to the right of the 
umbilicus with loops of small and large bowel prolapsing freely without a covering membrane.
• Exomphalos: Defect of anterior abdominal wall of variable size (diameter of base). It has a membranous 
covering (Amnion, Wharton’s jelly, peritoneum) and the umbilical cord is usually attached to the apex of 
the defect. The content of the large defect is usually liver and bowel but in the small defect the content 
may just be bowel loops.
• Fluid loss: Significant in gastroschisis due to the exposed loops of bowel.
• Hypothermia: Due to the larger exposed surface area.
• High incidence of associated syndromes and anomalies especially in exomphalos.
• Hypoglycemia can occur in 50% of babies with Beckwith-Wiedermann’s Syndrome (exomphalos, 
macroglossia, gigantism).Problems110.3 ABDOMINAL WALL DEFECTS

• Vomiting – bilious/non-bilious.
• Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) – fever, foul smelling, explosive diarrhoea, abdominal 
distension, septic shock. Has a high risk of mortality and can occur even after the definitive procedure.• Aganglionosis of variable length of the bowel, from distally, causing absent peristalsis and functional 
obstruction of the distal bowel.
• The primary aetiology has been thought to be due to cellular and molecular abnormalities during the 
development of the enteric nervous system and and a failure of migration of ganglion cells from the 
neural crest into the developing intestine, cranio-caudally fashion
• Genetic factors play a role with an increased incidence in siblings, Down Syndrome, congenital central 
hypoventilation syndrome and other syndromes.
• Short segment , Rectosigmoid aganglionosis: commonest, more common in boys.
• Long segment aganglionosis, beyond rectosigmoid.
• Total colonic aganglionosis: extending into the ileum or jejunum, almost equal male: female ratio.• Common cause of intestinal obstruction of the newborn.

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 18       RHEUMATOLOGY• JIA is a diagnosis of exclusion.
• Avoid diagnosing arthritis in peripheral joints if no observed joint swelling.
• Consider other causes, particularly if only one joint involved.
• Active arthritis can be present with the only signs being decreased range of movement and loss of 
function.
• In axial skeleton (including hips), swelling may not be seen. Diagnosis is dependent on inflammatory 
symptoms (morning stiffness, pain relieved by activity, pain on active and passive movement, limitation 
of movement). Investigations to exclude other diagnosis are important.
• In an ill child with fever, loss of weight or anorexia, consider infection, malignancy and other connective 
tissue diseases.
• In any child with severe pain (especially night pain), consider malignancy.Diagnosis and Differential diagnosis

Section 18       RHEUMATOLOGY• The diagnosis is essentially clinical; laboratory investigations are only supportive.
• No laboratory test or combination of tests can confirm the diagnosis of JIA.
• FBC and Peripheral blood film – exclude leukaemia. BMA may be required if there are any atypical 
symptoms/signs even if PBF is normal
• ESR or CRP – markers of inflammation.
• X-ray/s of affected joint/s: esp. if single joint involved to look for malignancy.
• Antinuclear antibody – a risk factor for uveitis
• Rheumatoid factor – assesses prognosis in polyarthritis and the need for more aggressive therapy.
*Antinuclear antibody and Rheumatoid factor are NOT required to make a diagnosis.
* Other Ix done as neccesary : complement levels, ASOT, Ferritin, immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM), HLA

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
• A chronic multisystem autoimmune condition with widespread inflammation of blood vessels and 
connective tissue, characterized by autoantibodies against self-antigens especially presence of 
Antinuclear antibody (ANA positive in 95% untreated SLE).
• Severity ranges from mild to life threatening and onset can be insidious or acute.
• Disease runs an unpredictable course, evolves over time and can result in significant long-term 
morbidity and mortality.
• Only 15-20% of all SLE patients occur before the age of 18 years.
• Onset commonly around puberty (median age 10-12 years).
• Majority (85%) present > 8 years, rare under age 5 years.
• Female: male ratio = 4.5:1.
• Clinical manifestations of juvenile SLE (jSLE) are protean, variable and often involve multiple organ 
systems.
• If jSLE is suspected, a meticulous assessment of all organ systems needs to be performed.
• In general, jSLE is a more severe disease when compared to adult SLE, often presenting with severe 
renal, cerebral and haematological manifestations, and with higher overall disease activity, accruing 
more organ damage with time resulting in more long term morbidity and mortality.Definition

• Diagnosis is based on the presence of clinical features supported by positive laboratory findings.
• Early diagnosis is crucial as a delay in treatment is associated with increased mortality and less 
likelihood of achieving remission.
• However, diagnosis can sometimes be challenging and thus early referral to a paediatric rheumatologist 
or paediatrician experienced in the care of jSLE is recommended.
• Differential diagnosis of SLE is broad and must include infection, malignancy and other inflammatory 
conditions.
• Various criteria have been developed for the classification of SLE
• (e.g. revised ACR criteria and SLICC criteria – see tables at the end of chapter) but these are primarily 
meant for research purposes.
• However, these criteria are often used to aid diagnosis. ACR criteria of fulfilling > 4 out of 11 criteria 
have high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (96%) for diagnosis of SLE.
• Caution: in some children with early SLE, these criteria may not be met yet and children can also 
present with isolated organ involvement (e.g. renal disease) which may not fulfill these criteria. Thus, 
criteria alone should not be a pre-requisite for diagnosis or instituting treatment.Diagnosis

high bilirubin, high GGT
Cardiac enzymes High (myositis, but note that myositis can be subclinical)
Urine FEME Proteinuria, haematuria, urinary casts (especially red blood cell cast). If proteinuria 
present, quantify with urine protein: creatinine index or 24-hour urine protein.
ANA Positive in 95% active untreated SLE. (Note: ANA is not diagnostic)

GeneralAimsMANAGEMENT

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 18       RHEUMATOLOGY• Immunosuppressive agents are now started early soon after diagnosis for rapid control of disease with 
improved long-term outcome and as a steroid-sparing agent.
• The choice of immunosuppressive agents is largely dictated by the organ system/s involved and the 
severity of involvement.
• Azathioprine (1-2.5 mg/kg/day) is the most commonly used immunosuppressive agent, especially for 
haematological, dermatological, serositis, vasculitis and sometimes as maintenance therapy for lupus 
nephritis. Generally well tolerated, side effects include nausea, GI symptoms, hair loss, bone marrow 
suppression.
• Major organ involvement like renal, cerebral, cardiac and pulmonary or other life-threatening 
manifestations usually will warrant pulses of IV Cyclophosphamide together with generally a single 
pulse of IV Methylprednisolone at monthly intervals of minimum 6 months.
• Cyclophosphamide (500-1000mg/m2/dose, max dose 1.2 g) is effective but associated with significant 
risks of infection (immunosuppression), haemorrhagic cystitis (prevented by Mesna), infertility and long 
term risk of cancer.
• Mycophenolate mofetil (600-1200mg/m2/day): used for induction phase of lupus nephritis, but the 
cost precludes its use as first line. It is also used for various other significant manifestations including 
haematological, dermato- logical and myositis. Main side effect is GI upset which can be minimized by 
gradual introduction.
• Methotrexate (10-15 mg/m2/week): arthritis, myositis and skin disease.
• Cyclosporin (3-5 mg/kg/day): nephritis especially membranous• Usually required by all children even in the absence of major organ involvement.
• Is the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy but is associated with significant side effects. Need to balance 
the requirement versus side effects carefully aiming for lowest possible dose to maintain disease control 
with the least side effects.
• Can be given orally (Prednisolone) or intravenously (Methylprednisolone).
• Initial dose varies depending on severity of disease and extent of organs involved, Prednisolone: 0.5-2 
mg/kg/day in at least 2 divided doses or IV Methylprednisolone 10-30mg/kg/day for 3-5 days, may be 
repeated up to weekly (maximum 1 gram, but generally not more than 500 mg/day as patients prone to 
infection/ sepsis)
• Tapering of steroid dose should occur once disease is controlled aiming for lowest possible dose. 
The rapidity of steroid taper depends on clinical response (resolution of symptoms and physical 
abnormalities), control of disease activity and towards normalization of laboratory findings (e.g. no 
cytopenias, improving or near normal complement levels, reducing proteinuria, improving urinalysis, 
lowering of antidsDNA levels)
• Generally, the higher the dose, the faster the taper. During active phase, will require divided doses. 
Once daily dose usually not recommended till 10 mg/day or less. Alternate day dosing may be 
inadequate to control ac- tive SLE despite lower risk of side effects.
Immunosuppressive agentsCorticosteroidsSPECIFIC PHARMACOTHERAPY
• An antimalarial recommended for all lupus patients as it can help reduce flares, reduce autoantibody 
production and cardio protective (lipid regulating, anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic, anti-hypertensive).
• Hydroxychloroquine (4-6mg/kg/day) is also useful for mild arthritis and skin disease.
• Needs yearly eye screening (for hydroxychloroquine induced retinopathy – present with subtle changes 
in colour vision and paracentral scotoma) and hearing assessment (ototoxicity)
• Caution in impaired renal function – consider stopping as increased risk of toxicity.Hydroxychloroquine

Section 18       RHEUMATOLOGY• Newer therapies are showing promise with many more being researched.
• The currently used biological agents include Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) and Belimumab (anti-B 
lymphocyte stimulator antibody), first FDA approved drug for lupus.• NSAIDs: myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis; and serositis
• Folic acid
• Bone health: Calcium, vitamin D
• Antihypertensive agents: as required in lupus nephritis. ACE inhibitors/ ARBs helpful to reduce 
proteinuria.
• Aspirin: low dose for those with significant titers of antiphospholipid antibodies, heparin (LMWH) 
followed by warfarin in the presence of thrombosis. (aim for INR 2.5-3.5)
• Intravenous immunoglobulin: sometimes used in ill children, in whom the possibility of severe infection 
cannot be excluded which precludes a pulse of iv Methylprednisolone.
• Plasmapheresis: occasionally used for severe refractory disease e.g. pulmonary haemorrhage, TTP .
At every clinic visit, perform meticulous assessment looking for:
• Evidence of active disease
• Detailed systematic assessment of all organ systems looking for symptoms of active disease & 
response to treatment.
• Complete physical examination (CVS, Respiratory, Abdomen, Neurology including muscle power, 
Musculoskeletal, Skin including scalp and hair & mucosa, Fundus) including growth parameters, 
blood pressure, pubertal staging.
• Complications of disease (e.g. organ damage, atherosclerosis) or treatment (e.g. infections, 
immunosuppression, steroid toxicity - myopathy, AVN, cataract, glaucoma).
• Psychological issues – self-image & self-esteem, school issues, bullying, family support.
• Compliance to treatment regimen
Perform the following investigations to support assessment with the aim to adjust treatment:
• Full blood count
• ESR
• C-reactive protein
• Renal profile
• Liver function test
• Complement 3 & 4
• UFEME
• UPCI (Urine protein-to-creatinine index): if has proteinuria
• antidsDNA levels: if positive and able to measure titers, useful to monitor disease activity.
• Ca, PO4, VBG: for those with significant renal disease
• Muscle enzymes: if has myositis
• PT/INR: if on warfarin
Investigations to be done on a yearly basis to look for complications
• Fasting serum lipid
• Fasting blood sugar or HbA1c
• Thyroid function testBiological therapies – for resistant casesOthers

Snake Related Injuries & Envenomation
• Different geographical regions and countries will have different snake species of medical importance.
• Snakes of medical importance in Malaysia are either equipped with venom or without venom. The 
venomous front-fanged snakes are from the family Elapidae (cobras, kraits, coral snakes and sea snakes) 
or Crotalinae (Pit vipers). Some non-front-fanged colubroids are also equipped with venom (cat snakes 
and keelbacks). Pythons may also pose a danger to humans.
• Snake venoms are made of a complex and diverse group of proteins, many with enzymatic activity. 
Envenomation syndromes are treated with timely administration of the appropriate antivenom in an 
adequate amount.
• The requirement for antivenom may differ from hospital to hospital based on the needs and presence 
of venomous snake species in the area.
• Early access to experts in the field (Clinical Toxicologist) will assist healthcare providers in snake species 
identification and optimal management for a favourable outcome.
Note: Assistance/query/consultation for identification and clinical management of snakebite can be 
obtained from the National Poison Centre Malaysia and the Remote Envenomation Consultation Services 
(RECS) Malaysia (http://mstoxinology.blogspot.com/p/recs.html).
• Local envenomation syndrome by cobra (Naja) species includes immediate pain, progressively 
worsening swelling, blistering and dermonecrosis. Systemic envenomation manifests as acute 
neurological and cardiac dysfunction including ptosis [an early sign], ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia 
[drooling of saliva], aphasia, dyspnea, muscle paralysis and dysrhythmia.
• Krait (Bungarus) species bites may cause minimal local effects and may go unnoticed. Systemic 
envenomation may be delayed and manifest as a sudden onset of rapidly progressive myalgia and 
muscle paralysis.
• Sea snake bites can be painless with minimal local effects. Systemic envenomation may present 
as generalised myalgia, stiffness, paresis, paralysis and myoglobinuria (dark coloured urine). 
Rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute renal failure.
• Pit viper bite envenomation may cause progressively worsening pain and swelling, haemorrhagic 
blisters, necrosis, hypovolaemic shock from third space fluid loss and bleeding due to coagulopathy.
Note: These clinical features are the manifestations of various toxins in the venom. Toxic venom 
components can vary even within the same snake species. The age, geographical distribution and prey 
specificity factors may influence the compositions of venom toxins.Introduction

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINSThe objectives are to provide basic life support, to reduce the rate of venom absorption and to prevent 
further complications. Prehospital care interventions include:
• Calm the patient down and move to safety.
• Remove jewellery on the affected limb and loosen tight-fitting clothing.
• Immobilise the affected limb with a splint or sling and reduce movements. Pressure Bandaging and 
Immobilization (PBI) are to be applied only by a trained first-aider. Indications for PBI include:
1) the snake is identified as krait, coral snake or sea snake
2) if the snake is unidentified, the transport time to the hospital is prolonged (more than an hour).
• If venom enters the eye (venom ophthalmia), immediately irrigate with copious amounts of clean water.
• Transfer all patients to the nearest healthcare facility with emergency care.
Note: Document all symptoms and signs that may manifest before arrival at the hospital. Do not interfere 
with the bitten area by applying a tourniquet, making incisions, sucking, rubbing, vigorous cleaning, 
applying herbs/chemicals, massage, or electrical shocks. Take several good-quality pictures of the snake at a 
safe distance, e.g., using a mobile phone camera. Avoid wasting time searching for or killing the snake. If the 
snake was killed, bring it along in a secure container.
• Triage to the appropriate zone and perform rapid clinical assessment.
• Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm and resuscitate as indicated.
• Obtain detailed history of presenting complaint:
1. time of incident
2. location of the incident
3. how exactly did the patient get bitten
4. what happened to the snake
5. part of the body bitten
6. what was done after being bitten
7. pain score progression (PSP) since incident
8. current complaints
9. allergy history (to horse or papaya) and other co-morbidities
• Perform close serial examination at fixed time intervals (every hour) for any changes over the bitten 
area (bite marks and surrounding skin), the rate of proximal progression of the oedema (RPP), PSP , 
palpable tender lymph nodes draining the area, and distal neurovascular status of the affected limb
Take serial pictures of the affected area.
• Examine for neurological dysfunction (tailored according to child’s age group), bleeding tendencies, and 
muscle tenderness and rigidity.
• Send initial laboratory investigations (full blood count, coagulation profile and Creatine Kinase) and 
repeat serially every 6 hours for the first 24 hours of the incident. Consider other tests as necessary 
(renal function tests, liver function test, fibrinogen level, D-dimer and urine examination). Review the 
trends.
• If laboratory blood test is not available or delayed and the diagnosis is unidentified snakebite or a pit 
viper bite, consider performing a serial bedside 20-min Whole Blood Clotting Test (20WBCT).
Put 2mL of venous blood in a clean and dry glass test tube, leave it standing for 20 min, and then gently 
tip it once.
Note: Unclotted blood suggests a pit viper bite with systemic envenomation.Prehospital & Primary Care

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Antivenom (AV) is the only proven antidote for envenomation.
• Not all snakebites, even by snakes equipped with venom, result in envenoming syndrome.
• Antivenoms carry a risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, the appropriate antivenom should be used only 
when it is indicated and administered as early as possible.
• Antivenoms appropriate for use in Malaysia are currently imported from Thailand and Australia.
• The dosage for children is the same as for adults (Table 1)
• Adrenaline, steroids, and antihistamines should not be given prophylactically unless indicated.
• Skin sensitivity test is not necessary as it poorly predicts anaphylactic reactions, may induce 
hypersensitivity and will cause unnecessary delay in antivenom therapy.
• If snake species is identified and AV is indicated, consider monovalent/ mono-specific antivenom.
• If snake species is unidentified and AV is indicated, consider Neuro Polyvalent or Hemato Polyvalent 
antivenom.Systemic envenomation
• Coagulopathy.
• Neurological abnormalities.
• Cardiovascular abnormalities.
• Generalised rhabdomyolysis / haemolysis.
• Acute kidney injury.
• Supporting laboratory results.
Local envenomation (with other considerations)
• Progressive significant oedema of the bitten area, especially if involving the fingers.
• Rapid speed of progression of oedema (trends of RPP) within a few hours.
• Palpable tender lymph node draining the affected limb.
• Rapidly expanding local necrosis.
Note: Helpful laboratory results suggesting envenomation include prolonged PT/APTT, raised INR, reduced 
fibrinogen level, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, anaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, myoglobinuria, 
and raised serum enzymes (e.g., Creatine kinase, aminotransferases).• Review immunisation status: administer IM anti-tetanus injection if indicated. (Note: Arterial puncture 
and Intramuscular injections are contraindicated if the coagulation profile is abnormal)
• Administer analgesia (avoid NSAIDs in pit viper envenoming) and antivenom as indicated.
• Admit to medical ward for close serial observation of the progress and response to therapy (vitals, RPP , 
PSP , LN and blood tests). If there are no signs and symptoms of envenomation for at least 24hrs or if an 
expert confirms that the snake is a non-venomous species and the patient is asymptomatic, the patient 
may not require hospitalisation.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Prepare adrenaline, hydrocortisone, antihistamines and resuscitative equipment prior to antivenom 
infusion.
• Reconstitute each vial of the freeze-dried antivenom with the solution supplied or 10ml WFI (water 
for injection). Gently swirl (never shake) to dissolve the freeze-dried powder. Further dilute the total 
reconstituted AV into 5-10ml/kg of crystalloid solution for children (maximum 500 mL).
• Infuse at a slow rate (1 to 2 ml/min) for 5-10 minutes and if there is no reaction, increase the rate to 
5-10mls/min to complete the infusion in less than one hour.
• Closely observe the patient during and for at least 1 hour after completion of the intravenous 
antivenom infusion. Document pain score before, during, and after the antivenom infusion. Document 
vital signs and clinical progression (RPP , PSP , LN) every 10-15 min, then hourly.
• Repeat antivenom administration if deteriorating neurotoxic/cardiovascular signs or brisk bleeding 1 to 
2 hours post AV, or persistent/recurrence of bleeding 6 hours post AV.
• Early hypersensitivity reactions are mostly rate-dependent non-immune anaphylaxis. Symptoms range 
from itching, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, palpitation, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema to circulatory 
shock.
• In the event of antivenom reaction:
• Withhold antivenom infusion.
• Give adrenaline IM 10 mcg/kg. 0.1 mL/kg of 1:10,000 (infant/young children) OR 0.01 mg/kg of 
1:1,000 (older children), into the upper lateral thigh and repeat 5 to 10 minutes if not improved 
(max of 0.5 mg total dose). If IM injection is contraindicated, administer slow IV boluses of 0.1 mL/
kg of 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL) solution every 3 to 5 minutes (maximum total dose of 0.3 mg).
• If not improving, start IV infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min titrated to response. 
• Give boluses of IV 0.9% saline at 20 mL/kg as required.
• Give slow IV antihistamine and steroid (e.g. chlorpheniramine maleate 0.2mg/kg), hydrocortisone 
4mg/kg/dose).
• Give nebulised adrenaline in the presence of stridor or partial obstruction.
• Give nebulised salbutamol in the presence of bronchospasm or wheeze
• Once the patient is hemodynamically stabilised and the signs and symptoms have subsided, the 
antivenom infusion should be restarted at a slower rate with close vigilance for further reactions.
• Pyrogenic reactions usually develop 1-2 hours after treatment and is believed due to pyrogenic 
contamination during the manufacturing process. Symptoms include fever, rigors, vomiting, tachycardia 
and hypotension.
• In the event of such a reaction, provide treatment as above and treat fever with paracetamol and tepid 
sponging.
• Late reactions (serum sickness) may occur between 1 to 12 days (mean 1 week) with symptoms of fever, 
arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, etc.
Treatment of serum sickness:
• Give chlorpheniramine maleate 0.25mg/kg/day in divided doses for 5 days.
• If fails to respond in 24hrs, give oral prednisolone (0.7mg/kg/day) for 5 days.Preparation and administration

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Should be considered in severe neurotoxic envenoming when antivenom is inadequate or unavailable.
• Give test dose of either IV Edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) 0.25mg/kg (max 10mg) or IV Neostigmine 
0.05-0.07mg/kg (max 0.5-2.5mg), with IV Atropine sulphate 50μg/kg (max 0.6mg).
• If patient convincingly responds, maintain with IV Neostigmine methylsulphate (50-100μg/kg) and 
Atropine, 4 hourly by continuous infusion.
• Provide respiratory support/assisted ventilation in those with clinical signs of respiratory compromise/
paresis.
• Give analgesia to relieve pain (avoid aspirin/NSAIDs). In severe pain, IV tramadol may be given. Pain 
relief will generally be seen following optimal antivenom therapy.
• Give broad-spectrum antibiotics if the wound appears contaminated with devitalised tissues or necrosis 
has developed.
• Correction of coagulation abnormalities with fresh frozen plasma and platelets is strictly per case-by-
case basis.
• Renal failure requires measurement of daily urine output, serum creatinine, urea and electrolytes. If 
urine output fails to increase after rehydration and diuretics (e.g. frusemide), start renal dose of 
dopamine (2.5μg/kg/minute IV infusion) and place on strict fluid balance. Dialysis may be required in 
severe cases of envenoming with renal complications.
• Clean and dress the wound. Debridement of necrotic tissues should be carefully carried out as needed 
and should not be mistaken with the debridement for necrotising fasciitis.
• Observe for the unlikely event of compartment syndrome (pain, swelling, cold distal limbs and muscle 
paresis). Orthopaedic opinion regarding surgical intervention must be supported with significantly 
raised (>40mmHg) intracompartmental measurements using Stryker or Wick catheters.
• Give an optimal amount of appropriate antivenom before any urgent surgical intervention.Anticholinesterases

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINSChapter 114:
Common Poisons
• Poisonings in paediatric patients are usually unintentional and the amount of toxin ingested is often 
minimal obviating the need for gastric lavage.
• However, in some situations related to dose per body weight even small amounts ingested can be fatal.
• A WHO report revealed that common poisoning agents among children in high income countries 
include pharmaceuticals, household products (e.g. bleach, cleaning agents), pesticides, poisonous 
plants, and bites from insects and animals, whereas, common poisoning agents in low-income and 
middle-income countries are fuels such as paraffin and kerosene, pharmaceuticals and household 
products.
• Ingestion remains the most common route of exposure for intentional or unintentional poisoning.
• The ingestion of anti-hypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, psychiatric drugs, toxic alcohols, 
salicylate oils and narcotics require special care and consideration.
PRINCIPLES OF THE APPROACH TO POISONING

=== PAGE 710 ===

694
PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• All poisoning cases should be investigated for any suspicion of neglect or abuse.
• Prehospital care personnel should be wary of contact or inhalation exposure causing poisoning.
• Gastric lavage in children has more risks than benefits and is very rarely performed. If performed, it 
should be limited to adolescent patients who have ingested large amounts of a potentially life-
threatening toxin and the antidote is not available. The airway must be secured and the toxin must not 
be corrosive or contain hydrocarbon agents.
• Skin decontamination with water is usually sufficient for corrosives. Continue irrigation till skin pH 
tested with litmus paper is neutral to ensure proper decontamination. Soap and water will be required 
for hydrocarbons and organophosphates. 
• Dermal exposure to toxic powders or solids should be brushed off prior to irrigation with copious 
amount of water.
• Neutralisation of acids with alkali or vice versa should never be attempted for fear of exothermic 
reactions resulting in dermal burns
• For some poisoning agents, haemodialysis or haemofiltration may be needed as a form of enhance 
elimination of the toxic agents.
• Administer antidotes if indicated. If antidote is not available at your centre, contact the hospital 
pharmacist on call to help and locate the source of the antidote.
• Ensure the patient is well hydrated with good urine output as this will facilitate renal excretion of most 
toxins.
• Toxinz®,Poisindex® and Uptodate® are a few resources currently available in most Malaysian hospitals. 
If the information you require is not available, you may consult a clinical toxicologist or call the national 
poison centre.• ACTIVATED CHARCOAL (AC)  
i. AC is a fine black powder prepared by pyrolysis (burning) of carbonaceous products. “Activation” 
increases the surface area of the particles.
ii. Toxins adsorb to activated charcoal and thus the total surface area of the charcoal preparation is 
related to the amount of drug able to be adsorbed.
iii. AC can be used in potentially toxic ingestions if the patient presents early (within 4 hours).
iv. AC should not be given in patients who are unable to protect their airway and are at risk of 
aspiration
v. Some toxins are not well adsorbed to activated charcoal. They include: 
 C Corrosives/caustics
 H Heavy metals (Fe, lead, lithium)
 A Alcohol (ethanol, toxic alcohol)
 R Rapid onset
 C Chloride & Iodine
 O Other insoluble in water
 A Aliphatic hydrocarbon (Petroleum distillate)
 L Laxatives 
vi. Single dose activated charcoal (SDAC) is rarely needed to be given in pediatric poisoning cases.
vii. The recommended dose for SDAC is 1g/kg body weight
viii. Multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) has proven efficacy in theophylline, phenobarbital, 
carbamazepine, dapsone, quinine toxicity, extended-release preparation and bezoar-forming 
medication.
ix. The recommended dose for MDAC is 0.5g/kg body weight 4 – 6 hourly, but beware of 
contraindications that may include absence of gut mobility or perforation or loss of protective 
airway reflexes
x. Complications of charcoal administration includes fatal aspiration, pneumonitis or small bowel 
obstruction. 
xi. For paediatric population, using opaque cups with a lid and straw may help facilitate/coax the 
patient into ingesting the AC and mixing with fruit juice or sweet drinks may be needed to make it 
more palatable.Key points

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Acetaminophen is a common poisoning in the paediatric population. Acute intentional ingestion is more 
commonly seen in adolescents while chronic poisoning is seen in preschool ages due to therapeutic 
errors. 
• A single ingestion of >150mg/kg acetaminophen can cause significant toxicity. Patients may be 
asymptomatic if presented early, or symptomatic with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. If left  
untreated, patients may progress to liver failure.
• Treatment involves the administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to  facilitate the synthesis 
of glutathione.

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• As history may be inaccurate especially in intentional poisonings it is important to correlate with clinical 
features and laboratory investigations
• Age <2 years is an independent risk factor for development of toxicity
• Acetaminophen level should be repeated 4 hours from the first level to identify “nomogram crossers” 
which can be seen in ingestions of extended release formulations and a small proportion of immediate 
release preparations.
**Nomogram crossers are roughly seen in 10% of population where the initial APAP level is below 
treatment line but the level declines slowly that subsequent level is above the treatment line on the RM 
nomogram.
• Rumack-Matthew (RM) nomogram is used only for acute single ingestions with known time of ingestion. 
• For single ingestions of unknown time, measure the APAP and AST. If APAP is >10ug/ml and/or AST is 
elevated, initiate NAC therapy.
• Patients who present > 8 hours of ingestion of potentially toxic dose or with symptoms of toxicity (right 
upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting) should be given NAC immediately.
• Evidence of hepatotoxicity in acute acetaminophen poisoning is usually delayed beyond 24hours. A 
normal AST in the initial stage of poisoning does not rule out hepatotoxicity.
• Consult toxicologist if the APAP level is >300ug/ml in acute single ingestions or in massive overdose

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• This type of poisoning is commonly seen in febrile infants and children where overzealous dosing of 
acetaminophen was given to maximize the effect or due to dosing error (failure to read medication label 
and dose).
• This poisoning has a higher risk of potential hepatotoxicity as the dose of acetaminophen is given 
beyond the prescribed frequency (e.g. QID or 4 hourly or even less).
• Consider RSTI acetaminophen poisoning in children who have  ingested:-
• >200mg/kg/day over 24 hours or
• >150mg/kg/day over 48 hours or
• For children < 6years old, >100mg/kg/day over 72 hours or more
• Since RSTI poisoning in children is unintentional, these patients generally present late with symptoms or 
with an elevated AST/ALT.
• The decision to start NAC therapy depends very much on the potential risk of hepatotoxicity.
• APAP level and AST/LFT should be measured immediately once diagnosis has been established.
• As the patient has taken multiple doses rather than a single dose the RM Nomogram cannot be used. 
• Start NAC therapy if the AST is elevated, regardless of the APAP level. NAC should also be started if the 
measured APAP > 10ug/ml with or without elevation of AST.
Indication to initiate NAC therapy in RSTI
• 10-fold dosing errors has been reported in young children due to confusion (between mg and ml) and 
incorrect route (oral given intravenously).
• There is limited experience with intravenous acetaminophen poisoning.
• The RM nomogram has not been extensively studied with intravenous compared to oral 
acetaminophen, hence should not be used to determine risk of hepatotoxicity and the initiation of NAC 
therapy.
• Due to paucity of data, it is reasonable to start NAC if the patient was given a single dose of >60mg/kg iv 
acetaminophen. Continue NAC until the APAP is undetectable.
• For patients on multiple therapeutic dosing of iv acetaminophen who present with evidence of 
hepatotoxicity (elevated AST), start NAC and continue until APAP is undetectable and hepatotoxicity 
resolves.Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• NAC is the antidote used to treat acetaminophen poisoning.
• Other than being a precursor to glutathione, NAC also provides cysteine as a substrate for sulphation. 
This is important as majority of the metabolism of APAP in children is through sulphation instead of 
glucuronidation as seen in adults.
• NAC has been shown to benefit patients with APAP induced liver injury (elevated AST) even with 
undetectable APAP levels
• It is available in iv and oral form
• NAC delivery should have as minimal interruption as possible to ensure continuous hepato-protection. 
The transition between the first to the second bag of iv NAC should not be delayed.
• Adverse reactions can be seen with iv NAC. Symptoms include flushing, aching, rashes, angioedema, 
bronchospasm and hypertension. 
• If adverse reactions occur, iv NAC should be withheld. Administer antihistamine and corticosteroids and 
restart the infusion after an hour at a slower rate.
• Most adverse reactions are mild and can be easily treated with low incidence of recurrence.
• For persistent severe adverse reactions despite treatment, iv NAC can be switched to oral NAC if the 
patient is able to tolerate orally well.
• Defervescent oral NAC tablets  (600mg/tab) can be used as an alternative to iv NAC, however caution 
should be practiced when using in very young children or patients on sodium restriction due to its 
sodium content. 
• Dosing regimen oral NAC : loading dose 140mg/kg. 4 hours after the loading dose, 70mg/kg should be 
given every 4 hours for an additional 17 doses  
 ÊDissolve the defervescent tablets in 100 - 150mls water. For children <20kg dissolve 4.8g oral NAC 
(defervescent tablets) in 100mls water (48mg/ml). Calculate the dose required based on body 
weight.
E.g. for a 10kg child, loading dose 1.4g (140mg/kg) = 1400 X 1/48= 29mls 
 ÊNausea and vomiting can occur with oral NAC. Antiemetics can be used to facilitate the delivery of 
oral NAC.
• NAC may cause mild prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and INR (≤2) without any evidence of liver 
injury. This adverse effect of NAC should be considered when assessing patients for coagulopathy.N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

• When determining KCC, adverse effects of NAC (prolonged PT/ INR) should be taken into consideration.
• If vitamin K is used and is effective in correcting prolonged PT/INR, this would indicate a viable liver.
• Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) should only be given when there 
is evidence of bleeding or risk of bleeding (performing invasive procedures) and not solely for correction 
of prolonged PT/INR. Correcting the PT/INR with exogenous clotting factors does not indicate an 
improvement in hepatic function, but instead will alter the interpretation when determining KCC.• King’s College Criteria (KCC) can be used to predict patients who may require liver transplant and early 
referral to a transplant centre.• NAC should be continued beyond prescribed ‘protocol length’ (beyond 20 hours) at a rate of 6.25mg/
kg/hr if there is evidence of one or more of the following:
 ÊOngoing hepatic injury / increasing AST
 ÊDetectable APAP
 ÊINR>2
 Êencephalopathy
• The decision to discontinue NAC depends on the patient’s clinical course
• NAC can be discontinued if 
 ÊPatient is clinically improving

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Ingestion of medicated oils containing methyl salicylate is a common cause of pediatric salicylate 
poisoning in Malaysia.
• Medicated oils can come with various concentrations of methyl salicylate and a lick or taste can 
sometimes prove fatal for children <6 years old.
• Ingestion of more than 150mg/kg is toxic.
• The primary toxicity of salicylate is to the brain.
• Because of its acidic pKa (pH3.5), salicylate toxicity worsens with acidosis, causing a shift of salicylate 
intracellularly, in particular the CNS and exerting its toxicity.
• The principle of managing salicylate poisoning is to create pH conditions and concentration gradients 
that favours the exit of salicylate from the CNS and enhance renal elimination.
• The initial evaluation of salicylate poisoning consists of close assessment of the respiratory rate, depth 
and acid base status.
• In the early phase of poisoning, respiratory alkalosis occurs due to direct stimulation of salicylate to the 
respiratory center. Over time, this progresses to mixed acid base (respiratory alkalosis and metabolic 
acidosis) and finally metabolic acidosis.
• Respiratory alkalosis may be transient or absent in very young children due to limited ventilatory 
reserve.
• A mixed acid base picture with acidemia warrants urgent intervention as the CNS protective effect of 
alkalemia is already lost.
• Always CHECK UNITS used in measured serum levels (mmol/l vs mg/L vs mg/dL). Errors in interpretating 
serum levels based on different units used/reported or unit conversion errors (e.g. mg/L to mg/dL) has 
resulted in disastrous salicylate fatalities.SALICYLATE (Acetylsalicylic Acid- ASA)

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• All symptomatic patients should be closely monitored and any patients presenting with mixed acid base 
picture should initiate urgent intervention.
• Principles of managing salicylate poisoning:
• limit absorption by using AC
• enhance renal elimination by alkalinizing the urine
• reduce CNS toxicity by correcting the acidosis
• restore intravascular volume and correct hypoglycaemia.
• Send salicylate level every 4 hours until peak is seen. All salicylate levels must be accompanied by a 
blood gas, serum K, urine pH.
• Interpretation of serum salicylate levels must be done concurrently with the patient’s acid base status 
(venous blood gas).
• A declining salicylate level with concurrent metabolic acidosis suggests shift of salicylate from the 
plasma to intracellular (CNS) indicating worsening toxicity rather than improvement.
• It is imperative to remember that any conditions contributing to acidosis in the patient will worsen CNS 
toxicity. 
• Sedation and intubation in this case can prove fatal as compensatory mechanism to correct the acidosis 
is lost, causing a rise in PCO2 and a rapid fall in serum pH. 
• Hyperbilirubinemia in neonates can cause a falsely elevated serum ASA levels. If there is a concern for 
falsely elevated salicylate levels, contact lab personnel for other methods in measuring ASA levels.
• Patients presenting with coma, stupor or delirium in salicylate toxicity should liberally be given dextrose 
even with normal blood sugar levels. Hypoglycorrhachia is known to occur in salicylism and can worsen 
neurotoxicity.
• Treat hypoglycaemia with 2-5ml/kg of 10% dextrose.
• MDAC (multidose activated charcoal) can be given if the patient present early <4 hrs of ingestion (*refer 
contraindications to AC). Start with 1g/kg loading dose followed by 0.5g/kg every 4-6 hourly for 36 
hours. Risk of vomiting, aspiration and intestinal obstruction must be considered when using MDAC.
Guide to urinary alkalization in salicylate poisoning:
• Urinary alkalization can enhance renal elimination of salicylate by 30%. 
 ÊStart with loading NaHCO 3 8.4% , 1-2mmol/kg  iv bolus then dilute 75 mls 8.4% NaHCO 3 in 425 ml 
5% dextrose and run at twice maintenance fluid requirement. Titrate rate to achieve target urine pH 
>7.5
• Start urinary alkalization for symptomatic patients, or acid base shows mixed respiratory alkalosis and 
metabolic acidosis with a normal pH or acidemia, or ASA > 30mg/dl.
• Urinary alkalization can be discontinued when the patient is clinically improving and the serum ASA 
levels < 20 mg/dl with a normal serum pH.Management

hemodialysis, urinary alkalinisation with NaHCO 3 can be withheld as the bicarbonate is supplied by the 
HD. 
• It is imperative to continue NaHCO 3 therapy for urinary alkalinisation once HD has been completed to 
ensure ongoing renal excretion of salicylate.

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Based on a demographic study analyzed by the Malaysia National Poison Centre from 2006 to 2015, 
the most cases reported under the household products classification include cleaners, bleaches 
and disinfectants. Others include hydrocarbons like kerosene and other household products such as 
mothballs etc. 
• Household products can be divided into two, product that can be potentially dangerous and also 
minimally toxic.
• To call a situation as minimally toxic ingestion, healthcare personnel must be able to: 
1. Identify the minimally toxic product and it’s ingredients
2. Know the amount of the minimally toxic product taken
3. Obtain reliable history
4. Assess that patient is asymptomatic following that minimally toxic product ingestion
5. Have a differential diagnoses such as allergic reaction, aspiration or non-accidental injury in the 
mind if the presentation skewed from asymptomatic to presence of signs and symptoms that is not 
expected for minimally toxic ingestion. 
Household Bleaches
• Household bleaches can be divided  into chlorine base bleach (whitening bleach)  or oxygen bleach 
(color-safe bleach).  
Chlorine based bleach
• Chlorine based bleach chemical content include sodium hypochlorite of around minimal concentration 
(~5%).
• It is a weak alkali and weak oxidizing agent and mainly caused oropharyngeal or upper GI irritation with 
signs and symptoms of nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. 
• When chlorine based bleaches are mixed with other substances like toilet cleaners  (acids) or glass 
cleaner (ammonia) , it can cause the release of chlorine or chloramine gas respectively, especially in 
enclosed space. Patient may inhales the chlorine or chloramine gas that can cause shortness of breath 
or bronchospasm. 
• Management for chlorine or chloramine gas inhalation is also supportive. Bronchodilators and steroids 
can be used. Nebulized sodium bicarbonate has been used with good outcome. Patient should be 
admitted until symptoms resolve. Patient that developed respiratory distress may need to be intubated 
and put on ventilatory support.
Oxygen bleach
• Oxygen bleach (colour-safe bleach) chemical content would include low hydrogen peroxide or peroxide-
releasing compound of around minimal concentration (~6%).
• Hydrogen peroxide toxicity is mainly due to the release of oxygen gas causing venous or arterial gas 
embolism. Each ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide releases around 10ml of oxygen gas. 
• Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide with concentration > 10% can cause GIT irritation includes hemorrhagic 
gastritis, gastric perforation, mucosal burn or systemic gas embolisation. 
• Inhalation can cause acute lung injury or respiratory distress.
• Ocular exposure can cause corneal ulcer or perforation. 
• Dermal exposure can cause burn or gangrene. 
• The management for bleach ingestion is generally supportive. Gastrointestinal decontamination is 
NOT recommended in single use agent. OGDS usually is not recommended either. The patient can be 
observe for improvement of signs and symptoms and encouraged to take orally.ManagementHOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS

• Examples of multipurpose cleaners are Magiclean, Cif etc.
• It may contain detergents and a glycol ether solvent (e.g. 2-butoxyethanol, a toxic alcohol).
• Other common additives include sodium hydroxide, hydrocarbons (e.g. pine oil) and antiseptic (e.g. 
alkanolamine).
• The ingredients are of low concentration in household products. Accidental ingestion typically produces 
local irritant effects only. No treatment is required.
• Intentional ingestion of large volume (typically >150ml) may produce GI corrosive effects.
• In rare occasion with massive volume ingestion (typically >500ml), toxic alcohol effects secondary to 
glycol ether poisoning have been reported. Typical clinical features of glycol ether poisoning include 
anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated osmol gap, CNS depression and renal impairment.
• Mainstay of treatment is supportive.
• Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally NOT indicated and maybe harmful.
• Accidental ingestion of small volume with symptoms limited to oropharyngeal irritating effects does not 
require treatment. Patients should be observed for symptoms progression or swallowing difficulties for 
at least several hours.
• Patients with symptoms suggestive of GI tract corrosive effect should be admitted for surgical 
assessment and upper endoscopy.
• For massive ingestion, monitor serial arterial blood gasses, osmol and anion gap. Consider hemodialysis 
in the presence of significant unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis or an abnormal high osmol gap. 
(*refer topic on toxic alcohol)
Detergents
• Detergent is used in many cleaning products.
• It mainly contain surface active agents (surfactant) consist of: 
1. Anionic surfactant type: 
 ͳMost common surfactant in bath soap, shampoo, general laundry detergents
 ͳExample are alkyl groups, ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium groups
 ͳIt can cause irritant effect
2. Non-ionic surfactant type: 
 ͳCommon in heavy duty laundry detergent 
 ͳExample are alkylpolyethoxylates, PEG groups, polysorbate groups
 ͳProduce less local irritation than anionic
3. Cationic surfactant type : 
 ͳDisinfectants, industrial products, fabric softener, swimming pool algicides
 ͳExample: benzalkonium chlorides
 ͳ10-15% are caustic. 0.1-0.5% caused significant mucosal irritation.  Esophageal or GIT burns are 
possible with ingestion of few mls of concentrated solution. CNS depression that progress to 
coma and shock are rare
4. Detergent pods contain surfactants and harmful chemicals. When bit into it can burst and can cause 
choking, chemical burns to airway mucosa and coma 
• Proteolytic/amylolytic enzymes are used in laundry detergents and presoaks to loosen soil and remove 
stain. Product contained these enzymes, can likely caused emesis.

 ͳAspiration is the main concern in hydrocarbons ingestion. Symptoms to suggest aspiration: choking 
and coughing during ingestion. 
 ͳRapid onset aspiration pneumonitis. Symptoms including shortness of breath, coughing and 
wheezing usually presented within 30 minutes after ingestion. Condition may rapidly progress to 
respiratory failure.
• Central nervous system:
 ͳRapid onset CNS toxicity with agitation or impaired consciousness.
 ͳSeizure may occur early and is the typical presentation of camphor poisoning.
 ͳIrreversible CNS damage is associated with prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons. The primary 
pathology is white matter degeneration (leukoencephalopathy). The clinical features include ataxia, 
spasticity, dysarthria and dementia (Painter’s syndrome).
• Cardiac:
 ͳHalogenated and aromatic hydrocarbons cause cardiotoxicity by sensitizing the myocardium to 
endogenous catecholamines.
 ͳDysrhythmia-induced sudden death, termed the “sudden sniffing death syndrome”  is well-described 
after inhalational abuse of these hydrocarbons.• Hydrocarbons with inherent toxicity (pneumonic: CHAMP)

• GI decontamination is not indicated after ingestion of aliphatic hydrocarbons.
• Hydrocarbons with significant systemic toxicity: gastric aspiration with nasogastric tube (for 
hydrocarbons in liquid form) within 1-2 hours post ingestion in patient with adequate airway protection 
may be attempted.
• Supportive management for aspiration pneumonitis and CNS toxicity. Consider airway protection in 
patients with impaired consciousness. 
• Prophylactic steroid and antibiotic use has no proven efficacy in limiting acute lung injury in 
hydrocarbon pneumonitis.
• Special considerations:
 ͳBeta-blockers (esmolol 0.025-0.1 mg/kg/min IV or propranolol 1-2 mg IV) is the antiarrhythmic drug 
of choice in aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons induced ventricular tachycardia and ventricular 
fibrillation.
 ͳN-acetylcysteine should be given as early as possible and preferably within 16 hours after 
chloroform or carbon tetrachloride ingestion or significant inhalational exposure.
 ͳSteroids can be used to treat chemical pneumonitis induced by aspiration of mineral oils. Consult 
medical toxicologist
Mothballs
Mothballs or other forms of moth repellants (e.g. cake type, tablets type, hanger types) can be classified 
according to its active ingredients:
1.   Camphor
2.   Naphtalene
3.   Paradichlorobenzene
4.   Pyrethroids
5.   Incense woods• Individual hydrocarbon toxicity:
 ͳHalogenated hydrocarbons, particularly carbon tetrachloride and chloroform are hepatotoxic.
 ͳAscending peripheral neuropathy may occur after exposure to n-hexane (normal hexane), methyl-N-
butyl stone (MnBK) or possibly to toluene.
 ͳAniline, nitrobenzene and nitrite containing hydrocarbons may cause methaemoglobinaemia.
 ͳHalogenated hydrocarbons and toluene are nephrotoxic. Chronic toluene abuse can cause transient 
renal tubular acidosis. Clinical findings are a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and 
aciduria.
 ͳMethylene chloride, a commonly encountered paint stripper is metabolised by liver P450 to carbon 
monoxide. Delayed CO poisoning may occur.
 ͳBenzene is haematotoxic, and is associated with haemolysis, aplastic anaemia, and haematologic 
malignancies. These effects are not found in other aromatic hydrocarbons.
 ͳChloracne: severe form generalised acne eruption after exposure to halogenated aromatic 
hydrocarbons (e.g. dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls).

ingestion.
• Onset of symptoms within 5-20 minutes after ingestion, peaks within 90 minutes.
• Other neurological effects including hallucination, agitation, CNS depression and coma have been 
reported.
Naphthalene:
• Significant naphthalene toxicity typically presents with delayed onset of haemolysis.
• Neurological symptoms including dizziness, headache and lethargy are reported after exposure.
• Toxicity can occur following ingestion, inhalation or dermal absorption.
• Metabolised in the liver to form the toxic metabolite alpha-Naphthol which is responsible for 
naphthalene induced oxidant stress.
• Toxic dose of naphthalene is highly variable and mainly depends on the G6PD status of the exposed 
individual. Hemolysis is more likely to occur in newborn infants, patients with severe G6PD deficiency or 
sickle cell disease.
• Heamolysis usually becomes clinically evident within 1-2 days after acute exposure. Anaemia secondary 
to haemolysis usually peaks at 3-5 days post exposure.
• Crosses placenta, can cause fetal haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia.

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINSOrganochlorines
• Lindane is commonly used as a pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies
• Any ingestion of lindane in a child with symptoms warrants close medical observation
• Symptoms include GI irritation, vomiting, drowsiness, seizures, tachycardia
• 1g of lindane topically can result in seizures in children, which typically occurs between 1-6 hours post 
exposure
• Treat seizures with benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Avoid phenytoin
• Activated charcoal can be given if presented within 1 hour of ingestion of liquid lindane preparation 
provided the patient is able to protect airway (* refer topic on activated charcoal )
• Pancytopenia and aplastic anemia has been reported in repeated exposure to lindane
• There is no specific antidote
Carbamates
• Symptoms are similar to organophosphate poisoning
• Overt muscarinic symptoms can be treated with iv atropine (*refer organophosphate poisoning)
• Pralidoxime is rarely indicated but can be considered in severe carbamate poisoning in conjunction with 
atropine if there is presence of acute cholinergic crisis 
• Pralidoxime is contraindicated if the carbamate is carbaryl
Organophosphates
• Organophosphates (OP) inhibits acetylcholinesterase enzyme and prevents the breakdown of 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This action causes continuous stimulation of cholinergic receptors (both 
muscarinic and nicotinic ) resulting in acute cholinergic crisis
• OPs undergo “aging” where inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzymes becomes irreversible thus 
rendering the enzyme useless
• Cholinergic stimulation can present with muscarinic symptoms (DUMBBELS- diaphoresis, urination, 
miosis, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation, salivation) or nicotinic symptoms (mydriasis, 
tachycardia, hypertension, fasciculations, paralysis) 
• It is important to remember that muscarinic symptoms (DUMBBELS) are not always initially 
predominant or clinically dramatic. Some OPs may present with predominant nicotinic symptoms 
(mydriasis, tachycardia) or even a mixture of both nicotinic and muscarinic symptoms
• The main contributor to mortality in acute OP poisoning is hypoxia either from bronchorrhea 
(muscarinic) or hypoventilation from respiratory muscle paralysis (nicotinic)
• Atropine is used to treat muscarinic  symptoms only. The aim in atropinisation is to achieve drying of the 
bronchial secretions so that gas exchange is feasible to correct hypoxia and/or for cardiac stability by 
keeping MAP>60mmHg in severe bradycardia causing hypotension
• Pralidoxime is an oxime that reverses the acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition by the OP provided 
aging has not occurred. Recent multiple publications with meta analysis have not shown benefit of 
pralidoxime in improving outcomes for OP poisoning. Its use remains controversialPyrethrins/pyrethroids
• Found in household insecticide sprays (e.g. Baygon, Shieldtox, Ridsect)  and mosquito coils sold at 
supermarkets and department stores 
• Pyrethrins are naturally occurring insecticides derived from the chrysanthemum plant. Toxicity from 
ingestion or dermal exposure is relatively low in humans although seizures has been reported in large 
ingestions
• Hypersensitivity reactions (acute bronchospasm, anaphylaxis) and direct irritant effects are more 
commonly seen. There is no specific antidote. Treatment is supportive, wash exposed dermal areas with 
copious amount of soap and water. Treat bronchospasm and anaphylactic reactions accordingly

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Resuscitate and stabilise the patient as necessary.
• Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed areas copious amount of soap and water.
• Examine the patient for signs and symptoms of a cholinergic toxidrome (nicotinic- muscle fasciculation/
weakness, fatigue, seizures or muscarinic- salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, GI upsets, emesis, 
sweating, miosis, bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension).
• If there is hypoxia, determine the underlying cause. If it is due to bronchorrhea, give IV Atropine 
0.02mg/kg every 5 minutes, doubling the dose each time, till secretions have reduced. If it is due to 
hypoventilation from respiratory muscle paralysis, intubate and support ventilation.
• Atropine administration is guided by the drying of secretions rather than  the heart rate or pupil size.
• Once atropinisation has been achieved, a continuous infusion of atropine can be started at 0.025mg/
kg/hr. Patients on atropine infusion needs to be monitored for atropine toxicity (over atropinisation - 
tachycardia, flushing, agitation/restlessness, urinary retention, absent bowel sounds).
• Atropine infusion can be tapered down once the acute cholinergic symptoms have resolved.
• Intermediate syndrome can be seen in some OP poisoning. It is a syndrome of delayed muscle weakness 
without any cholinergic symptoms. Intermediate syndrome can occur between 24-96 hours after acute 
poisoning, and after resolution of acute cholinergic crisis. Patients who develop intermediate syndrome 
will have prolonged respiratory paralysis that may last from a few days to weeks. Support   ventilation 
until muscle paralysis improves.
• Avoid the use of succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant for intubation as its action can be prolonged with 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition in OP poisoning.
• Treat hypotension with norepinephrine and epinephrine.
• Dopamine is not recommended to treat hypotension.Management

• Remove contaminated clothes and wash skin with soap and water.
• Avoid unnecessary administration of oxygen, unless significant hypoxia.
• Gastric lavage is not recommended as paraquat is corrosive and may cause gastrointestinal injury. 
Some herbicides are also mixed with hydrocarbons. In large intentional ingestions, secure the airway 
and a Ryle’s tube can be inserted gently, with stomach contents aspirated to remove   any toxins in the 
stomach.
• Administer activated charcoal at a dose of 1g/kg in paraquat poisoning if the patient present early, 
within 1 hour of ingestion. 
• Ensure good hydration to correct hypovolemia from GI loss.
• There is no specific antidote.
• Multiple treatment modalities including immunosuppression with corticosteroids and 
cyclophosphamide, NAC, high doses of vitamin C,E and glutathione has not shown improvement in 
outcome in human or animal studies and is currently not recommended.
• Patients with confirmed paraquat poisoning who develop respiratory distress and shock have a poor 
prognosis. Palliative care with oxygen and analgesics should be administered for patient comfort.
Glyphosate
• Glyphosate has a relative low toxicity unlike paraquat, toxicity is mainly from the co-formulation and 
surfactants e.g. polyoxyethyleneamine.
• Glyphosate is corrosive in high concentrations.
• Glyphosate is not the same as organophosphate insecticide . It does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase 
enzymes and thus do not clinically exhibit any acute cholinergic symptoms in poisoning.
• Main toxicity is GI irritation, presenting with severe vomiting and diarrhea.
• Avoid gastric lavage, but in large ingestions, gastric aspirate using NG tube can be attempted if the 
patient presents early.
• Hydration is key to volume replacement.
• Hemodialysis can be considered in severe poisoning with multiorgan failure.• Common herbicides seen in Malaysia are glyphosate and paraquat. 
• Glyphosate which is now the primary content of Roundup® may cause significant GI injury and is 
managed symptomatically.
• Paraquat is sold as a green liquid.
• All patients who present with a history of herbicide ingestion must have a urine paraquat level on 
arrival. Test should be repeated if negative at 4 to 6 hours post ingestion if the first test was performed 
at less than 4 hours post ingestion.
• Patients who have ingested paraquat may present with the following :
• Difficulty breathing (early)
• Diarrhea and vomiting
• Dysphagia and drooling of saliva
• Ulcers in the mouth and esophagus
• Jaundice and liver failure
• Renal failure

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• BB are widely used in the treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, 
thyrotoxicosis, etc.
• Propranolol is the most lethal beta -blocker in poisoning.
• Sotalol is unique among beta blockers for its inhibition on the potassium channel resulting in prolonged 
QTc and torsades de pointes.
• Other beta blockers are less toxic and about 1/3 of the overdosed patients remained asymptomatic.
• About 1/3 remain asymptomatic.
• Co-morbid conditions like CCF, sick sinus syndrome or co-ingestion of other cardioactive toxins increase 
likelihood of toxicity.
• Cardiovascular toxicity: hypotension, bradycardia, CCF, QRS and QT prolongation on ECG.
• Respiratory depression and apnea.
• CNS: delirium, coma, seizures; seizures (28%) is also frequently reported in propranolol poisoning. 
Occurs most often in the setting of hypotension.
• Hypoglycemia (relatively common in children after beta blocker ingestion).
• Bronchospasm appears to occur only in susceptible patients. 
• Toxicity generally manifests early within 6 hours.• BB are well absorbed with a rapid onset of action, peaks within 1-4 hours (longer for sustained-release 
preparations).
• Lipid solubility has a role in determining toxicity and elimination:
 ͳHigh lipid solubility:
Usually hepatic metabolism.
Can pass Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and have CNS effects; delirium, coma and seizures.
Example: Propranolol which is highly lipid soluble. Its elimination half-life ranges from 2-3 hours in 
therapeutic dose to 14 hours in overdose.
 ͳPoor lipid solubility (high water solubility)
Renal elimination.
Examples: Atenolol is the most renal-dependent BB concerning excretion and renal failure may 
cause its accumulation and toxicity. (Half-life extends from 6 hours to 73 hours in renal failure 
patients with CrCl <5 ml/min.) It also has the smallest Vd (0.8 L/kg) among the beta blockers and is 
minimally protein bound (<5%), which makes it amenable to haemodialysis and haemoperfusion.
Membrane stabilising activity may affect toxicity:
 ͳMembrane stabilising activity (e.g. propranolol) has the potential to cause sodium channel blockade 
and resultant dysrhythmias.
• Alpha-adrenergic blockade:
 ͳCarvedilol: nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with alpha 1 blocking activity.
 ͳLabetalol: both alpha and beta antagonism in the following ratio: oral 1:3 and IV 1:7
 ͳTherefore, it is important to identify the particular beta blocker in the management of overdose.Beta-Blockers (BB)

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• CCB are used for angina, hypertension, arrhythmias and migraine prophylaxis.
• CCB poisoning is one of the most lethal overdoses by prescribed drugs.
• Generally, non-dihydropyridine (verapamil, diltiazem) is more dangerous than dihydropyridine. 
• Sustained released preparations result in delayed onset and prolonged symptoms.
• Verapamil is the most dangerous CCB in overdose. 
• The drug is well absorbed orally.
• Volume of distribution ranges from 5.5. L/kg (verapamil) to 5.3 L/kg (diltiazem) to 0.8 L/kg (nifedipine).
• Hepatic metabolism via cytochrome CYP3A.
• Potential for drug-drug or drug-food interaction with protease inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics and 
grapefruit juice.
• Verapamil and diltiazem may decrease clearance of drugs like carbamazepine, theophylline, HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors, most HIV-protease inhibitors.
• Onset is rapid (1-2 hours) for regular preparations and can be delayed (up to 12-18 hours) for SR 
preparations.
• Decreased functional actin-myosin complexes result in depressed contractile force. Impedes Ca2+ influx 
responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarisation in pacemaker cells.
• All CCBs inhibit L-type voltage-gated slow calcium channels. This decreases calcium influx into cardiac 
and smooth muscle cells. In myocardium this causes decreased contractility and conduction.
• In peripheral vasculature there is relaxation and peripheral vasodilatation.
• Each CCB has varying affinity for the different L-type Ca2+ channels, however, selectivity may be lost in 
massive overdose.• Ensure ABCs.
• GI decontamination can be considered; activated charcoal 1 g/kg within 1-2 hours post ingestion.
• Treatment options for hypotension and bradycardia (generally follow the listed sequence with increased 
severity but needs individual consideration):
 ͳAtropine : 0.5 mg IVI in adult or 0.02 mg/kg in children (minimum 0.1 mg, up to 3 mg in severe 
cases)
 ͳGlucagon:  Bolus: 2-5 mg IV over 1 minute up to 10 mg (50 mcg/kg in children). Maintenance: 2-5 
mg /hour in D5% (20-50 mcg/kg/hour in children) titrated clinically.
 ͳInotropes and vasopressors:  Adrenaline or Noradrenaline is a reasonable first choice. Maintain a 
low dose, escalating doses of catecholamines may have a deleterious effect.
 ͳPacing, intra-aortic balloon pump, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, extra-corporeal circulation.
 ͳTreatment for prolonged QRS in propranolol poisoning : NaHCO 3 1-2 mEq/kg IV bolus for QRS more 
than 100 msecs.
 ͳIntralipid : can be considered for the rapidly collapsing patient who is not responsive to other 
treatment modalities that has been optimised. Initial dose 20% 1.5 ml/kg bolus over 1 minute 
followed by infusion at 15 ml/kg/hour for 30-45 minutes. Repeat bolus can be given. Recommended 
maximum cumulative dose of 12 ml/kg. Caution: intralipid can cause fat embolism and acute 
pancreatitis. Consult medical toxicologist.

signs may be delayed 6-8 hours. Delayed effect up to 15 hours has been reported.
• Reflex tachycardia and peripheral flushing may be the first signs in CCB overdose especially with 
dihydropyridines (nifedipine, amlodipine).
• Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock.
• CNS depression is uncommon and should prompt for consideration of co-ingestions. Dizziness, altered 
mental status, seizures, stroke, coma may occur in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
• Pulmonary: acute lung injury/ARDS.
• Hyperglycaemia: insulin release from pancreatic beta islet cells also calcium mediated. In CCB overdose, 
decreased calcium influx leads to decreased insulin release. This is usually the early sign of CCB toxicity.
• Ischemic bowel injury: reported in significant CCB overdose and is often a complication that limits 
adequate GI decontamination. 
• Ensure ABCs.
• GI decontamination: activated charcoal 1 g/kg within 1-2 hours post ingestion. 
• Treatment options for hypotension and bradycardia (generally follow the listed sequence with increased 
severity but need individual consideration):
 ͳAtropine : 0.5 mg IV in adult or 0.02 mg/kg in children (minimum 0.1 mg up to 3 mg in severe cases).
 ͳCalcium : increased extracellular calcium creating a concentration gradient across the cell membrane 
promoting intracellular calcium flux. This is a high priority in the treatment of CCB toxicity. IV 
calcium gluconate 10% 0.7ml/kg is recommended to be given over 2 minutes. Up to 3 doses can be 
given. Effect is transient and re-dosing is often required. Monitoring of serum Ca levels is required in 
repeated dose and infusion. Calcium concentration of up to 2 times upper limit of normal or ionised 
calcium level of 2 mmol/L can be tolerated in treatment of CCB poisoning.
 ͳHigh dose insulin (HDI)  - Consult a medical toxicologist :
i. Standard therapy for severe CCB overdose. Take 30 mins to 1 hour to have effect.
ii. Supported by animal studies and human cases series, demonstrated increased myocardial 
contractility without producing ischemia and improved survival.
iii. HDI may exert its beneficial effects through increased inotropy, increased intracellular glucose 
transport and vascular dilatation.
iv. Goals of HDI is to maintain perfusion of essential vascular beds and organs not to increase BP 
or MAP alone. Clinical parameters like adequate urine output, clear mentation and biochemical 
markers like lactate levels is more relevant as compared to blood pressure and pulse alone.
v. Start with 0.5-2 unit/kg/hour and titrate up to 10 unit/kg/hour. Aim to improve MAP>60mmHg, 
titrate up to achieve target.
vi. Some centres would also advocate a bolus dose of 0.5 to 1 unit/kg/hour before starting the 
infusion.
vii. Adverse effects:
a. Hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance especially hypokalaemia.
b. Insulin receptor mechanism for hypoglycemia is saturable at a dose much below the insulin 
use for HDI therapy. Clinical experience shows that hypoglycemia can be managed easily.
c. Frequent blood sugar check (every 10-20 minutes when HDI dose is titrated, every 30-
60 minutes once insulin dose is stable). Dextrose infusion at 0.5g/kg/hr can be started to 
maintain blood sugar level between 5.5 mmol/L to 11 mmol/L.
d. Monitor serum potassium (hourly during titration and every 6 hours once stable). Consider 
supplement if potassium concentration falls below 2.8-3.0 mmol/L. Keep serum K between 
2.8-3.2, do not over correct K to “normal range” as this is not true hypokalemia and 
potassium will rebound once toxicity resolves.Clinical Manifestations

i. Escalating dose of catecholamines can increase blood pressure and heart rate but they also 
increase SVR which may result in decreases in cardiac output and perfusion of vascular beds. 
The increased myocardial oxygen demand that results from catecholamines and vasopressors 
may be deleterious in the setting of hypotension and decreased coronary perfusion.
ii. As HDI therapy takes 30 minutes to 1 hour to take effect catecholamines are often started 
before HDI can take full effect.
iii. Adrenaline or noradrenaline is a reasonable initial choice.
iv. Inotrope dose should be titrated down if there is adequate response from HDI and calcium 
therapy.

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Sulphonylureas (SU) is a class of OHA used to treat diabetes mellitus (DM). Its major mechanism of 
action is to stimulate the endogenous insulin release from pancreatic beta cells.
• Hypoglycaemia is a major concern.
• Onset of hypoglycaemia symptoms can be delayed up to 18- 24 hours.
• Sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release from the pancreas.
• Clinical features of hypoglycaemia include neurological manifestations such as drowsiness, weakness, 
confusion, coma, seizure or cerebral edema and sympathomimetic manifestations such as sweating, 
tachycardia and hypertension.
• Single tablet ingestion can result in hypoglycaemia, especially in children.
• Consider GI decontamination with activated charcoal if airway is protected.
• Monitor for hypoglycaemia.
• Consider further investigations in patients presenting with unexplained hypoglycaemia and suspected 
SU exposure.
• In any overdose (even single tablet in non-DM patient or in children), observation for at least 24 hours is 
recommended.
• If hypoglycaemia occurs treat conventionally with IV dextrose (0.5-1g/kg Dextrose 25% in children and 
D10% in neonates) followed by food (frequent small snacks) if the patient is able to tolerate orally.
• Avoid continuous infusion of iv hypertonic dextrose . Encourage patients to take orally (carbohydrates 
and protein) as frequently as possible. Since sulphonylureas increases insulin release, continuous 
hypertonic dextrose infusions will only result in transient hyperglycaemia followed by a fall in plasma 
glucose and possibly back to hypoglycaemic levels.
• Aim to maintain serum glucose between 5.5-8mmol/l
• Glucagon is not recommended as antihypoglycaemic in sulphonylurea poisoning as its action in delayed 
and it can stimulate insulin release from the pancreas resulting in prolonged hypoglycaemia.
• For refractory hypoglycemia consider octreotide in addition to dextrose and food.
• Octreotide is the synthetic analogue of somatostatin. It counteracts the hypoglycaemic effects of SU by 
inhibiting pancreatic beta cell insulin release.
• Consider in patients with SU poisoning presenting with refractory hypoglycaemia (e.g. requiring 
repeated IV dextrose bolus or escalating dose of dextrose infusion to maintain normal blood glucose).
• Recommended dose is 50 mcg (1 mcg/kg in children) subcutaneous injection every 6 hours for 24 
hours. Further doses may be required for SU with long duration of action.
• After stopping octreotide, the patient should be observed for another 24 hours for recurrent 
hypoglycaemia.
• Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic agent used for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. Its 
pharmacological effects are mainly mediated by inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhanced 
peripheral glucose utilisation. Sulphonylureas

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• Metformin is not metabolised in humans. It is excreted in urine unchanged. Renal insufficiency impairs 
metformin excretion leading to high plasma metformin concentrations and toxicity even at therapeutic 
doses. The duration of action for standard release preparations was reported to be 1.3-4.5 hours.
• Metformin inhibits hepatic elimination of lactate. Metformin associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a life 
threatening complication of metformin toxicity. MALA was reported in two groups of patients:
 ͳIntentional metformin overdose.
 ͳPatients with renal impairment taking therapeutic doses of metformin.
• In addition patients with pre-existing illnesses predisposing to lactate accumulation (e.g. liver disease, 
alcohol abuse, major illnesses causing hypotension and poor tissue perfusion) have high chance of 
developing MALA. With modern intensive care the first group of patients usually have favourable 
prognosis, while the reported mortality rate in second group of patients is around 50%.
• Mild poisoning cases present with GI disturbance only (e.g. nausea and vomiting).
• Severe poisoning cases typically present with MALA, which is diagnosed by the presence of elevated 
serum lactate and anion gap metabolic acidosis.
• The initial presentation of MALA can be non-specific with symptoms including tachypnea, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, malaise, myalgia and dizziness. Patients with worsening lactic acidosis will 
deteriorate into multi-organ failure with impaired consciousness, hypothermia, hypotension, renal 
failure, ventricular arrhythmias and respiratory insufficiency.
• Hypoglycaemia is not a common presentation in metformin poisoning unless the patient has massive 
overdose or has concomitant hypoglycaemic agents poisoning.
• Blood glucose, blood gases, anion gap, serum lactate concentration and renal function.
• CXR, ECG and other baseline investigations as clinically indicated.
• Investigations for precipitating cause of MALA (e.g. UTI).
• Mainstay of management is supportive.
• Administer activated charcoal for significant overdose.
• For cases with mild symptoms and no metabolic disturbances an observation period for 6 hours post 
ingestion is recommended.
• Early intensive care and hemodialysis are recommended.
• Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation. Consider IV sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg for significant 
metabolic acidosis.
• Hemodialysis (HD) with bicarbonate dialysate can be life saving especially in patients with renal 
impairment. HD effectively removes both circulating metformin and lactate. Early HD is usually 
recommended as patients can deteriorate rapidly with unstable hemodynamics.
• Hemofiltration (e.g. CVVH) can be considered for patients with unstable hemodynamics and HD is not

bradycardia and hypotension, depressed consciousness. (Opioid toxidrome, *refer toxidrome table)
• Some synthetic opioids like tramadol are seizuregenic and can cause hypoglycemia and acute serotonin 
toxicity
• Methadone can cause QT prolongations and cardiac arrhythmias (torsades des pointes) 
• Synthetic opioids like methadone and tramadol will not test positive in a urine drug screen for opioids/
opiates. A negative Urine Drug Screen (UDS) does not rule out the absence of a drug. Always correlate 
clinical symptoms to a toxidrome.
• Dextromethorphan is a unique morphinan drug that is commonly abused by adolescents for its 
euphoric effects. It is available over the counter as cough and cold medication. In high doses it acts 
on opioid receptors. It also inhibits serotonin reuptake and can cause serotonin toxicity. It is partially 
reversed with naloxone.
• Ingestion or exposure to any substance abuse or narcotics warrants a referral to SCAN team for further 
investigation.
• Assist ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device immediately if patient is bradypneic and hypoxic. 
Prepare equipment for intubation.
• IV Naloxone is the antidote used to treat opioid poisoning. 
• Most opioid poisoning in children is unintentional, hence the use of naloxone and the risk of developing 
complications is low. If the patient is not opioid naïve, caution should be practiced when giving 
naloxone (use lower doses) to avoid precipitating opioid withdrawal in the patient . 
• The aim of using naloxone is to reverse respiratory depression to avoid intubation and mechanical 
ventilation. Complete restoration of consciousness level is not the necessary endpoint in naloxone 
therapy. Start at: 
• 0.1mg/kg bolus for children weighing 5-20kg. If no improvement in respiratory rate in 2 minutes, 
administer 2mg, then 4 mg, then 10mg then 15mg. If still no improvement in RR, consider other 
causes of respiratory depression
• 2mg bolus for children weighing>20kg. If no improvement in RR in 2 minutes, give 4mg then 10mg, 
then 15mg. Consider other causes if no improvement of respiratory depression
 
• Higher doses of naloxone may be required for opioid reversal in children in view of higher doses per kg 
body weight.
• Repeat dosing may be required or a maintenance infusion. For naloxone infusion, give a loading dose 
at 50% of effective reversal dose, followed by 2/3 the effective reversal dose per hour. E.g. the patient 
received 2mg, 4mg and 10mg of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression. Total reversal dose =16mg. 
To start naloxone infusion, give loading iv naloxone 8mg bolus followed by 10mg/hr infusion.
• Continue to monitor respiration closely preferably in an intensive care unit.
• Naloxone reversal is short duration. Overdoses on long acting opioids such as methadone will require 
longer duration of treatment and observation. Naloxone can cause noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, 
cardiac dysrhythmias and hypertension
• All patients on naloxone infusion should be monitored closely in a critical care setting.
• If high doses of naloxone did not reverse respiratory depression and level of consciousness, proceed 
to intubation and further resuscitation. Investigate for other   causes of reduced consciousness and 
respiratory depression.
• Continue to monitor for signs of respiratory depression up to 24 hours once patient is off naloxone.
• Monitor for seizures and hypoglycemia in tramadol exposure. Seizure may occur even at therapeutic 
levels.ManagementOPIOIDS

airway and intubate if needed.
• Check blood glucose level and correct hypoglycemia with intravenous dextrose.
• Gastric lavage is rarely indicated due to rapid absorption of toxic alcohols. Activated charcoal is not 
recommended.
• Fluid resuscitation for hypotension due to vasodilation.
• Sodium bicarbonate may be administered in methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning with severe 
acidemia to trap and enhance renal clearance of formate and favour the formation of less toxic 
metabolites. Aim to achieve serum pH >7.2.
• Send serum methanol/ethylene glycol/ethanol.
• The key in managing toxic alcohols is to prevent formation of toxic metabolites and enhance elimination 
of these toxic alcohols (parent compounds) and its formed toxic metabolites. This is achieved by 
blocking the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme with ethanol or fomepizole and dialysis.
• ADH blockade with ethanol or fomepizole will result in a longer half life of the toxic alcohol due to 
inhibition of its metabolism. Dialysis is used to eliminate the toxic alcohol and its toxic metabolites from 
the plasma.
• Oral ethanol may be used to buy time while obtaining fomepizole and while awaiting hemodialysis. 
Caution: oral ethanol can cause CNS depression, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, transaminitis and 
pancreatitis. For effective ADH blockade with ethanol, serum ethanol needs to be frequently 
monitored and maintained > 100mg/dL. This may be challenging if lab support for serum ethanol is 
not readily available. Dose: give loading dose 0.8g/kg 20% oral ethanol diluted in fruit juice (A 20% V/V 
concentration yields 200mg/ml). Maintenance dose: 80mg/kg/hr 20% oral ethanol diluted in juice.
• Aim a narrowing of anion gap while on oral ethanol. If anion gap widens and metabolic acidosis worsens 
( without the availability of serum ethanol), this may indicate inadequate ADH blockade with oral 
ethanol and the oral dose needs to be increased.
• Intravenous ethanol is not recommended for pediatric patients.
• Fomepizole is an excellent ADH blocker. It is the antidote of choice for toxic alcohol poisoning. Due to its 
high cost, it is available only in selected centers. Loading dose 15mg/kg iv fomepizole diluted in 100mls 
dextrose 5% and infuse over 30 minutes, followed by maintenance dose 10mg/kg every 12 hours. 
Maintenance dose needs to be adjusted every 48 hours (after 5 doses).
• Please discuss with a medical toxicologist if fomepizole is indicated for treatment to avoid wastage, and 
dose adjustment due to autoinduction of its own metabolism.
• Both fomepizole and oral ethanol doses needs to be increased/adjusted during hemodialysis. Consult 
medical toxicologist.
• Monitor the patient’s acid base balance, serum lactate, blood sugar, liver enzymes, renal function and 
anion gap closely.
• Isopropyl alcohol can cause deep CNS depression and gastrointestinal bleed. Treatment is supportive.
• Indication for hemodialysis in methanol poisoning:
• Severe methanol poisoning
• Coma, seizures, new vision deficit, metabolic acidosis (serum pH<7.15) or persistent metabolic 
acidosis despite antidote and supportive measures
• Serum methanol >50 mg/dL in the absence of an ADH blockade

• Amphetamine was first synthesised in 1887.
• In 1980s there was an outburst of “designer drugs” in response to the legislation of amphetamine 
control. More than 200 chemicals are derived from the basic amphetamine structure and are 
collectively known as amphetamine derivatives or amphetamine-like substances.
• Two examples are 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) and methamphetamine.
• The primary mechanism of action is the release of endogenous catecholamines such as noradrenaline, 
serotonin and dopamine, resulting in sympathomimetic poisoning and psychomotor agitation.
• Methamphetamine is usually in a form of crystal and can be rapidly absorbed by inhalation, ingestion 
and injection. It has greater CNS potency than other amphetamines and longer half life around 19-34 
hours. The duration of effect may last more than 24 hours.
• Clinical effects of MDMA begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and lasts 1-6 hours typically. The half-life is 
around 8 hours and occasionally effects may be present for more than 24 hours.
• Typical CNS stimulant effects.
• “Tweaking” is described as psychomotor agitation and psychiatric symptoms similar to schizophrenia 
(paranoid, hallucinations, agitation, delusions) in methamphetamine users. Patients are the greatest 
danger to themselves and others through violent acts.
• “Met-bug” is described as visual or tactile hallucinations of “bugs” experienced by methamphetamine 
user. The patient may have self-harm behavior secondary to the hallucination.
• MDMA will cause euphoria, increased alertness, jaw clenching, tooth grinding (bruxism) and restless 
movement in “therapeutic dose” and generally has less sympathetic effect, much more euphoria 
compared with amphetamine/methamphetamine.
• MDMA was reported to cause significant hyponatremia, probably due to increased release of 
vasopressin and its commonly occurred in the morning after using MDMA.
• The serotonergic activity of MDMA is as risk factor for serotonin syndrome, particularly when combined 
with SSRIs.
• Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum has been reported.
• Acute cerebral (infarction or hemorrhage) or cardiac (e.g. arrhythmias, ischemia) events are common 
causes of death.
• Chronic use of MDMA causes permanent damage of serotonergic neurons in the brain.
• Bedside urine toxicology kit for drugs of abuse detecting amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA 
as separate entities. Positive results are generally expected up to several days after their use.
• Clinical utility of bedside kit is limited as both false positive (e.g. pseudoephedrine) or false negative are 
really common. Caution in interpretating urine drug screening, always correlate clinical symptoms to 
UDS finding.
• Hyponatremia is common in MDMA use. Check sodium level in any patient with altered mental status.
• CT brain, ECG, CXR, blood test such as FBC, RP , LFT, CK(CE) and others as clinically indicated.SYMPATHOMIMETICS

• Rapid “cooling”, use of benzodiazepines (BZD) and supportive measures are the mainstay of treatment. 
Hyperthermia needs to be treated aggressively as it contributes to mortality in sympathomimetic 
toxicity.
• Avoid physical restraints as it worsens rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.
• Use benzodiazepines to control agitation in titrated manner. Give intravenous BZD, repeated every 
5-10 minutes as necessary until patient “calms down”. Large doses of BZD may be required to control 
agitation for certain cases. Calming the patient down reduces the risk of rhabdomyolysis and acute 
kidney injury. Start with bolus midazolam 0.05-0.1mg/kg for children <5 yrs, 0.025-0.05mg/kg for 
children age 6-12 years. Double the dose every 5-10 minutes until the patient is calm. Aim to calm the 
patient, and not sedation. There is no ceiling limit for benzodiazepine in managing sympathomimetic 
toxicity. Once patient is calm, midazolam infusion can be started to maintain catecholamine 
suppression, reduce agitation and hypertension, improve hyperthermia and reduce the risk of 
rhabdomyolysis.
• For severe rhabdomyolysis (high creatinine kinase and urine myoglobinuria), urinary alkalinisation can 
be used to prevent myoglobin deposition in renal tubules. (* refer urinary alkalinisation in salicylate 
poisoning). 
• Anti-pyschotics use to control agitation in acute sympathomimetic toxicity is not recommended due 
to its unfavorable risk-benefit consideration (lowers seizure threshold and risk of developing acute 
serotonin syndrome/neuroleptic malignant syndrome).
• IV fluids to treat hypotension from volume loss.
• Serotonin syndrome/ toxicity can be seen with some stimulants like methamphetamine, MDMA 
and amphetamine. Suspect acute serotonin toxicity if the patient has tremors, hypereflexia, clonus 
(spontaneous or inducible), ocular clonus, tachycardia, altered mental state. (* refer management of 
acute serotonin toxicity in SSRI/antidepressants).
• Treatment for seizures:
 ͳBenzodiazepine
 ͳPhenytoin is NOT recommended
 ͳRule out hyponatremia and intracranial pathology
• Treatment for hypertensive emergencies:
 ͳBenzodiazepine and “calm down” patient first
 ͳTitrate with short acting nitrates e.g. GTN; nitroprusside 
 ͳConsider phentolamine, calcium channel blockers if inadequate response.TreatmentSection 19       POISON AND TOXINS

Section 19       POISON AND TOXINS• The newer generation of psychiatric drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and 
nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NSRI) are safer compared to tricyclic antidepressants.
• As a result they are prescribed more often then TCAs but may still cause significant toxicity in children.
SSRI
• There is no specific antidote. Monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome (agitation, tremors, hyperlexia, 
confusion, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, loss of muscle coordination, muscle rigidity, 
sweating, vomiting, diarrhea and headache). In severe serotonin syndrome, patient may develop high 
fever, seizures, irregular heart beat, rhabdomyolysis and unconsciousness.
• Treatment for serotonin syndrome is supportive.
• Benzodiazepines e.g. IV Diazepam can be administered for seizures and to control agitation. Avoid 
physical restraints, as this will worsen rhabdomyolysis. Avoid phenytoin for seizures.
• Good hydration is required to enhance drug elimination and treat rhabdomyolysis.
• Treat hypotension with fluids resuscitation.
• Monitor ECG for QT prolongation.
• Stop all drugs that may cause serotonin toxicity.
• Cyproheptadine (serotonin antagonist) is rarely indicated as serotonin toxicity generally resolves within 
24 hours. It can be considered in severe serotonin toxicity although evidence to support its use is 
currently lacking. Consult medical toxicologist for input in severe cases.PSYCHIATRIC  DRUGS - ANTIDEPRESSANTS

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 19       POISON AND TOXINSTricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) 
• Patients can present with hypotension from vasodilatation, cardiac dysrhythmias from sodium channel 
and potassium channel blockade, CNS depression and seizures.
• Deaths in TCA poisoning are related to Na channel blockade effect causing life threatening arrhythmias 
and seizures.
• Principle of treatment is to overcome Na channel blockade and reduce binding of TCA to Na channels 
with sodium bicarbonate.
• Intubate and protect airway if airway is compromised or patient is comatose.
• Place patient on continuous ECG monitoring to look for QRS widening, QT prolongation, cardiac 
conduction abnormality.
• Monitor for arrhythmias, hypotension, altered sensorium or seizures, which usually occurs within the 
first 6 hours after ingestion.
• Treatment should be instituted for widened QRS complex and wide complex arrhythmias. QRS widening  
(QRS >100ms) can be corrected with sodium bicarbonate 8.4% bolus at 1-2mmol/kg. Repeat boluses  
until QRS narrows or until serum pH>7.55. Aim narrowing of QRD < 100ms.
• Since TCA can cause potassium channel blockade and QT prolongation, monitor serial serum K, Ca and 
Mg. Keep K>4, Ca> 2.1 and Mg> 0.9. 
• Keep patient on continuous cardiac monitoring for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.  If QT > 
450ms with the presence of any arrhythmias, administer bolus IV MgSO 4 25-50mg/kg dilute in 10ml 
dextrose 5% over 10-15mins. Repeat if necessary 5-15 minutes later. If in doubt, consult a medical 
toxicologist
• Use ACLS/APLS guidelines to treat life threatening arrhythmias.
• Identify the antidepressant taken to anticipate other possible complications
• Treat seizures with benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Do not use phenytoin as it will worsen sodium 
channel blockade.
• Hemodialysis/PD is not effective as tricyclics are protein bound. Important to avoid the use of 
flumazenil for reversal of co-ingestion of benzodiazepines as this can precipitate tricyclic induced seizure 
activity.

Parents’ /caregivers’ capacity to provide history that is accurate is essential especially with  children and 
young people as one of the earliest red flags across the ages would be changes in the pattern of behaviour 
that remain despite strategies to manage them.
Some common behaviour and emotion red flags
• Ongoing behaviour problems at daycare, school or at home 
• Hyperactivity or constant movement that is beyond regular playing
• Unusual fears or worries
• Not taking part in activities like playtime at the playground or extracurricular activities
• Persistent sadness that lasts two weeks or more
• Withdrawing from or avoiding social interactions
• Hurting oneself or talking about hurting oneself
• Talking about death or suicide
• Outbursts or extreme irritability
• Changes in appetite
• Frequent physical symptoms such as abdominal aches and headaches
• Possible worsening of existing medical conditions despite adequate treatment provided, such as more 
episodes of AEBA, or flare of eczemaCommon Red Flags indicating potential mental health issues in children

When to refer?
Consider referrals when the patient and family /caregivers would benefit from further support. This 
excludes SCAN related situations.
1. Mention the concerns you have identified:
a. “I am concerned that you /your child may be experiencing difficult feelings or thoughts. It may be 
useful to speak to our social worker /counsellor /mental health professional who can help your 
family more.
2. Involve the child and family in the decision to seek help as this would ensure participation and not seem 
intrusive.

Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)The average age of onset is about 10 years, although children as young as 5 or 6 years may be diagnosed 
with OCD. Though children can start showing symptoms of OCD around age 3, this is extremely rare. 
Children may have OCD when unwanted thoughts, and compulsive behaviours happen frequently, take up a 
lot of time (more than an hour a day), interfere with their activities, or make them very upset. Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder, mood disorders, and Autism Spectrum Disorder are often comorbid with OCD. Comorbid 
depression is associated with increased OCD symptom severity and functional impairment.

https://www.ementalhealth.ca/index.php?ID=14&m=survey
Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a multi-network brain disorder that encompasses a broad range 
of neurological symptoms. The common presenting symptoms in Paediatrics include numbness, weakness, 
seizure-like events, or abnormal gait or movements.
This diagnosis is often considered when presenting symptoms cannot be fully explained by neurological or 
other medical conditions, or by substance use, and are not intentionally produced. Often, many of these 
children have underlying psychological distress or difficulties in their home environment. A separate 
diagnosis of Factitious Disorder is given if symptoms are malingered. 
One of the key features is that the symptoms may be inconsistent, often changing during examination. An 
accepting rather than a judgmental approach towards symptoms is helpful.

PAEDIATRIC PROTOCOLS
5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 20       CHILD PSYCHIATRYIn conversion paralysis, the child loses the use of half of his or her body or of 
a single limb, but the paralysis does not follow anatomical patterns and is often 
inconsistent upon repeat examination.
The conversion child may report feeling faint or fainting, but no autonomic 
changes are identified, such as pallor, and there is no associated injury. In 
addition, the fainting spells have a “swooning” character to them, heightening 
the drama of these events.
Conversion aphonia may be suspected when the child  is asked to cough, for 
example, during auscultation of the lungs. In contrast with other aphonias, the 
cough is normally full and loud.
Conversion anaesthesia may occur anywhere, but it is most common on the 
extremities. One may see a typical “glove and stocking” distribution; however, 
unlike the “glove and stocking” distribution that may occur in a polyneuropathy, 
the areas of conversion anaesthesia have a very precise and sharp boundary, 
often located at a joint. 
In conversion paraplegia, one finds normal, rather than increased, deep tendon 
reflexes, and the Babinski sign is absent. In doubtful cases, the issue may be 
resolved by demonstrating normal motor evoked potentials.Paralysis
Syncope
Aphonia
Anaesthesia
ParaplegiaDifferentiating features of conversion disorder symptoms
SYMPTOM DISTINGUISHING FEATURES AND PRESENTATION
In conversion disorder, the child, though complaining of recent onset of 
blindness, neither sustains injury while manoeuvring around the clinic room nor 
displays any expected bruises or scrapes. The pupillary reflex is present, thus 
demonstrating the intactness of the optic nerve, chiasm, tract, lateral geniculate 
body, and mesencephalon.
In conversion deafness, the blink reflex to a loud and unexpected sound is 
present, thus demonstrating the intactness of the brain stem.
Children with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures generally lack response to 
treatment with antiepileptic drugs or have a paradoxical increase in seizures with 
antiepileptic drug treatment. The negative history of injury or loss of control of 
bladder or bowel during the seizure episode is also significant.
When weights are added to the affected limb, patients with functional tremor 
tend to have greater tremor amplitude, whereas in those with organic tremor, 
the tremor amplitude tends to diminish.
Useful distinguishing features include an inverted foot or “clenched fist,” adult 
onset, a fixed posture that is apparently present during sleep, and the presence 
of severe pain.Blindness

Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is likely when all of the following 3 criteria are met:
• Sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms (minutes to hours)
• Life-threatening Airway and/or Breathing and/or Circulation problems
• Skin and/or mucosal changes (flushing, urticaria, angioedema)
• Previous severe reaction.
• History of increasingly severe reaction.
• History of asthma.
• Treatment with β blocker.
When anaphylaxis is fatal, death usually occurs very soon after contact with the trigger. Fatal food reactions 
cause respiratory arrest typically after 30–35 minutes; insect stings cause collapse from shock after 10–15 
minutes; and deaths caused by intravenous medication occur most commonly within 5 minutes
The clinical signs of critical illness are generally similar because they reflect failing respiratory, cardiovascular 
and neurological system. Use ABCDE approach to recognise and treat anaphylaxis.• Airway problems:
• Airway swelling e.g. throat and tongue swelling.
• Hoarse voice.
• Stridor.
• Breathing problems:
• Shortness of breath (bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema).
• Wheeze.
• Confusion caused by hypoxia.
• Cyanosis is usually a late sign.
• Respiratory arrest.
• Circulation problems
• Shock.
• Cardiovascular collapse with faintness, palpitations, loss of consciousness.
• Cardiac arrest
• The following supports the diagnosis:
• Exposure to a known allergen for the patient
• Other considerations:
• Skin or mucosal changes alone are not a sign of an anaphylactic reaction
• Skin and mucosal changes can be subtle or absent in up to 20% of reactions (some patients can 
have only a decrease in blood pressure, i.e., a Circulation problem)
• There can also be gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. vomiting, abdominal pain, incontinence)Introduction

Recognition and Assessment of Pain
The health care provider should decide on an appropriate level of pain relief for a child in pain and also 
before a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.
We can assess a child in pain using an observational-based pain score or a self-assessment pain score. 
Repeated assessment needs to be done to guide further analgesia.
The two examples are FACES Pain Scale (Wong & Baker) and Verbal Pain Assessment Scale (Likert Scale).
FACES Pain Scale - The child is more than 3 years old and he or she is asked to choose a face on the scale 
which best describes his / her level of pain. Score is 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.
Verbal Pain Assessment Scale
A child who is more than 8 years old is asked to rate his or her pain by circling on any number on the scale 
of 0 to 10.Self Assessment Pain Score:Observational-based Pain Score: The Alder Hey Triage Pain Score

Sedation and Analgesia for Diagnostic and Therapeutic 
Procedures
• Sedation  – reduces state of awareness but does not relieve pain.
• Analgesia  – reduces the perception of pain.
• Patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.
• Blocked airway including large tonsils or adenoids
• Increase intracranial pressure
• Reduce level of consciousness prior to sedation
• Respiratory or cardiovascular failure
• Neuromuscular disease
• Child too distressed (may need higher level of sedation or even anaesthesia)
The patients should be in Class I and II of the ASA classification of sedation risk.
• Class I – a healthy patient
• Class II – a patient with mild systemic disease, no functional limitation
• Consent
• Light restraint to prevent self injury
• At least a senior medical officer, preferably PLS or APLS trained.
• A nurse familiar with monitoring and resuscitation.Procedural sedation means minimal or moderate sedation / analgesia.
• Minimal  sedation (anxiolysis): drug-induced state during which the patient responds normally to 
verbal commands. Although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, ventilatory and 
cardiovascular functions are unaffected.
• Moderate  sedation / analgesia: drug-induced depression during which the patient responds to verbal 
commands either alone or accompanied by
• light tactile stimulation. The airway is patent and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular 
function is adequate.
Note:
• Avoid deep sedation and general anesthesia in which the protective airway reflexes are lost and the 
patient needs ventilatory support.
• However, some children require general anesthesia even for brief procedures whether painful or 
painless because of their level of distress.Definitions

Practical Procedures
Selective sedation and pain relief is important before the procedures.
(please refer to chapter on Sedation and Analgesia for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures )
APLS courses have been conducted in Malaysia since October 2010.
Kindly refer to the latest APLS textbook 7th Ed 2023 for further details:
• Chapter 19: Practical procedures: airway and breathing
• Chapter 20: Practical procedures: circulation
Please request for assistance from a senior doctor in Paediatrics or Anaesthesiology Department 
whenever necessary.  Other methods of opening airways are not described here, e.g. Guedel airway, 
nasopharyngeal airway, laryngeal mask airway and surgical airway.  
• Securing and maintaining a patent airway is very important in a patient with respiratory or 
cardiopulmonary failure or cardiac arrest.  
• To maintain and protect airway, in children with impaired CNS function or airway obstruction.
• In respiratory failure, when bag-mask ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is

• Oesophageal intubation (ETT may be in-situ initially, then dislodged).
• Right lung intubation.
• Trauma to the upper airway.
• Hypoxia.
• Aspiration of gastric contents.
• Subglottic stenosis (late).1. Position infant with head in midline and slightly extended (sniffing position in a child).
2. Continue bag and mask ventilation up to 3 minutes if necessary (omit this pre-oxygenation step 
in cardiac arrest) with 100% oxygen till well saturated. In newborns adjust FiO 2 accordingly until 
oxygen saturation is satisfactory between 94 to 98%.
3. Medication used for induction of anaesthesia prior to intubation:
• Consider induction with IV Ketamine 1 to 2 mg/kg (can be used safely in head injury, caution in 
patients with hypertension or glaucoma).
• Consider muscle relaxant if no contraindication, e.g. IV Succinylcholine (1-2 mg/kg) or 
Rocuronium (1-2 mg/kg).  Caution: Intubator must be able to bag the patient well (with 
adequate chest rise) and have good intubation skills before giving muscle relaxant.
• Relative contra-indications for Succinylcholine  are burns, spinal cord injury, neuromuscular 
disorders, malignant hyperthermia, hyperkalaemia and renal failure. 
• Sedation with IV Midazolam (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) and IV Morphine (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) may also be used.
4. Monitor the child’s vital signs continuously throughout the procedure.
5. Insert a nasogastric tube either before induction or as soon as possible afterwards, aspirate gastric 
contents and leave a 50ml syringe attached. 
6. Once child is fully sedated / muscle relaxed, introduce the laryngoscope blade between the tongue 
and the palate with left hand  and advance to the back of the tongue while maintaining head 
position with the right hand.
7. When epiglottis is seen, lift blade upward and outward to visualize the vocal cords. Suction 
secretions if necessary.
8. Using the right hand, insert the ETT from the right side of the infant’s mouth; a stylet may be 
required.
9. Keep the glottis in view and insert the ETT between the vocal cords until the desired length. 
10. If intubation is not done within 30 seconds, the attempt should be aborted and oxygenation re-
established before a further attempt.
11. Once intubated, remove laryngoscope and hold the ETT firmly in place.  Connect to the self-inflating 
bag and continue bag-mask ventilation.
12. Confirm the ETT position by looking for equal chest expansion, listen to air entry over both axillae 
and over the stomach. ETCO 2 capnography should be used if available, to definitively confirm tube 
placement. 
13. Secure the ETT with adhesive tape and connect to the ventilator.
14. If a cuffed ETT is use, inflate the cuff to achieve adequate seal, and check cuff pressure, ensure <25 
cmH 20.
15. Order and review a chest x-ray to confirm optimal ETT tip position below the vocal cords but above 
the carina (at the level of T1-T3).
ComplicationsProcedure• Scissors and adhesive tape.
• Sedation (Midazolam + Morphine, consider Ketamine if experienced).
• Consider preparing inotropes / vasopressors and IV fluid bolus for unstable patients, if needed.
• Consider muscle relaxant (Rocuronium or Succinylcholine).

Section 22       PRACTICAL PROCEDURES• After opening the airway, start ventilation using a self-inflating bag with an appropriate-sized face 
mask, or through the ETT of an intubated child. 
• Provide supplemental oxygen, and titrate to keep SpO 2 between 94-98%.  
• Aim for gentle chest rise. Avoid excessive tidal volumes and rapid ventilation, which may cause 
gastric distension, inhibit ventilation and increase risk of aspiration. 
• In a critically ill child with respiratory failure, adjust the ventilation rate according to age (between 
15-30 per minute).2. BREATHING – Positive Pressure Ventilation
3. CHEST COMPRESSIONAge Ventilation rate in cardiac arrest
Infant 25 breaths per minute
1-8 years 20 breaths per minute
9-12 years 15 breaths per minute
>12 years 10-12 breaths per minute• In cardiac arrest, bag-mask ventilation 
is provided with a ratio of 2 ventilations 
to 15 chest compressions while 
performing CPR. 
• Following intubation, aim for a 
ventilation rate at the lower limit of 
normal for age, with uninterrupted 
chest compressions.
1. Start IMMEDIATE chest compressions if: 
• There are no signs of life.
• There is no pulse.
• There is a slow pulse (less than 60 beats per minute) with poor perfusion.  
2. Chest compressions should be delivered over the lower half of the sternum, at a rate of 100-120 
compressions per minute.
3. A ratio of 15 compressions to 2 ventilations is maintained, whatever the number of rescuers. Once 
the child has been intubated, compressions should be continuous, with ventilations via ETT at the 
appropriate rate. 
4. Rescuers performing compressions should change every 2 minutes, to avoid fatigue and maintain 
optimal performance.  
5. The chest should be compressed to one third of the anterior-posterior diameter, about 4 cm for an 
infant and 5 cm for a child. 
6. Allow for complete chest recoil in between compressions.   
7. The child in cardiac arrest receiving uninterrupted CPR should be connected to a cardiac monitor as 
soon as possible to ascertain whether it is a non-shockable (asystole or pulseless electrical activity) 
or shockable (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) rhythm.  
8. Adrenaline should be given immediately for non-shockable rhythms. 
9. Immediate defibrillation should be performed for shockable rhythms.
10. If no help has arrived after 1 minute of CPR, emergency services should be contacted. Apart from 
this, CPR should be uninterrupted unless the child shows signs of life.

4.1.  VENEPUNCTURE & PERIPHERAL VENOUS LINE
Indications
Equipment
Complications Technique
1. Identify the vein for venepuncture.  Secure the identified limb and apply tourniquet or equivalent.  
Note that the peripheral veins will be collapsed in a child with peripheral vasoconstriction, e.g. in 
circulatory shock or high fever. 
2. Local warming, transillumination techniques (under 2 years) or ultrasound guidance, if available, 
may facilitate venous access. 
3. Non-pharmacologic techniques such as parental presence, oral sucrose or distraction may reduce 
pain and anxiety in awake children. 
4. TA may be applied with occlusive plaster an hour earlier or spray with ethyl chloride for a short 
procedure.
5. Clean the skin with alcohol swab.
6. Puncture the skin and advance the needle or catheter in the same direction as the vein at a 15-30 
degree angle.
7. In venepuncture, blood is collected once blood flows out from the needle. The needle is then 
removed and pressure applied once sufficient blood is obtained.
8. In setting an intravenous line, the catheter is advanced a few millimetres further.  Once blood 
appears at the hub, then withdraw the needle slightly while advancing the catheter over the needle.  
9. Remove the tourniquet and flush the catheter with heparinised saline.
10. Secure the catheter and connect it to either rubber bung or IV drip.
11. Immobilise the joint above and below the site of catheter insertion with restraining board and tape.

Section 22       PRACTICAL PROCEDURESinclude:
• Pain, tenderness at insertion site especially during infusion or giving slow bolus drugs.  
• Redness. 
• Swelling.
• Reduced movement of affected site.  
• (Note – the inflammatory response can be reduced in neonates especially preterm babies)
Inspection of injection sites
• The insertion site should be observed for signs of extravasation:
• At least every 4 hours for ill patients.  
• Sick preterm in NICU: should be done more often, even every hour for   continuous infusion.
• Each time before, during and after slow bolus or infusion.
• Consider re-siting the intravenous catheter every 48 to 72 hours.
If moderate or serious extravasation occurs, especially in the following situation:
• Preterm babies.
• Delay in detection of extravasation.
• Hyperosmolar solutions or irritant drugs (e.g. glucose concentration > 10%, sodium bicarbonate, 
calcium solution, ALL inotropes, blood products, cloxacillin, fusidic acid, acyclovir, TPN).
• Immediately stop infusion, inform senior colleague and counsel parents.
• Refer to plastic surgeon / orthopaedic surgeon urgently. 
• Elevate the affected limb and provide analgesia as needed.
• Performing ‘subcutaneous saline irrigation’ as soon as possible for severe extravasation injuries, 
especially in neonates (ref Davies et al. Preventing the scars of neonatal intensive care. Arch Dis 
Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 1994;70: F50-F51) .
Give IV morphine for analgesia, then perform numerous subcutaneous punctures around the 
extravasated tissue and flush slowly with generous amount of normal saline to remove the irritant. 
Ensure that the flushed fluid flows out through the multiple puncture sites.  
• If the patient is in shock, the venous backflow (or arterial backflow in the event of accidental 
arterial cannulation) may be sluggish.
• BEWARE!  An artery can be accidentally cannulated, e.g. brachial artery at the cubital fossa and the 
temporal artery at the side of the head of a neonate, and be mistaken for venous access.  Check for 
resistance to flow during slow bolus or infusion (e.g., frequent alarming of the perfusor pump), skin 
blanching, pulsation in the backflow or a rapid backflow.  Rapid bolus or infusion of drugs into an 
artery can cause ischaemia of the limb.  Where in doubt, gently remove the IV cannula.
• Ensure prescribed drug is given by the proper mode of administration.  Some drugs can only be 
given by slow infusion (e.g. fusidic acid) instead of slow bolus in order to reduce tissue damage from 
extravasation.
• Avoid medication error (correct patient, correct drug, correct dose, correct route).
• Avoid nosocomial infection.Extravasation injury (prevention is the priority) Signs

       CANNULATION
Procedure
1. Check the ulnar collateral circulation patency by Modified Allen Test.  
2. The radial pulse is identified. Other sites that can be used are posterior tibial (posterior to medial 
malleolus while the ankle is in dorsiflexion) and dorsalis pedis artery (dorsal midfoot between the 
first and second toes while the ankle is in plantar flexion). 
3. Ultrasound guidance can improve success rate and reduce complications.
4. TA may be applied with occlusive plaster an hour before procedure.  
5. Clean the skin with alcohol swab.  
6. Dorsiflex the wrist slightly.  Puncture the skin and advance the catheter in the same direction as the 
radial artery at a 30-400 angle.  
7. The catheter is advanced 2-3 millimetres further when blood enters the hub, then withdraw the 
needle while advancing the catheter.  
8. Ensure good flow, then flush gently with heparinised saline.  
9. Once the peripheral artery is successfully cannulated:  
• Ensure that the arterial line is functioning.  The arterial pulsation is usually obvious in the 
tubing.
• Connect to T-connector, 3-way stop-cock (red colour), and syringe pump. May consider Luer-
lock arterial line tubing in older children, to reduce risk of accidental disconnection and 
bleeding.  
• Label the arterial line and the time of insertion.
10.  Run the heparinised saline at an appropriate rate:
• 0.5 to 1.0 mL per hour for neonates.
• 1.0 mL (preferred) or up till 3.0 mL per hour for invasive BP line (stop if skin mottling or 
blanching). 
11. Immobilize the joint above and below the site of catheter insertion with restraining board and tape, 
ensuring the tape is not too tight.

5th Edition For Malaysian Hospitals
Section 22       PRACTICAL PROCEDURES• Arteriospasm, which may lead to ischaemia and gangrene, especially in neonates.
• Haematoma or thrombosis
• Infection (rare)
Prevention of digital, distal limb ischaemia and gangrene
• AVOID end arteries e.g. brachial (in cubital fossa) and temporal artery (side of head) in babies 
(BEWARE - both these arteries can be accidentally cannulated and mistaken as ‘veins’ especially in 
ill patients with shock). 
• Test for collateral circulation
• If a radial artery is chosen, please perform Modified Allen Test (to confirm the ulnar artery 
collateral is intact) before cannulation.  
• If either the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis artery on one foot is chosen, ensure that these 2 
arteries are palpable before cannulation.  
Circulation chart
Perform observations and circulation charting of distal limb every hour in the NICU/PICU, and whenever 
necessary to detect for signs of ischaemia, namely:
• Colour - pale, blue, mottled.
• Cold, clammy skin.
• Capillary refill > 2 seconds.
• Remove IV cannula.
• Confirm thrombosis with ultrasound doppler.
• May consider warming the contralateral unaffected lower limb to induce reflex vasodilatation of the 
affected leg.
•  Ensure good peripheral circulation and blood pressure 
• Anticoagulant drugs and thrombolytic agents should be considered  
• Refer orthopaedic surgeon if there are concerns of persistent ischaemia or gangrene. 
Reminders:
• PREVENTION of limb ischaemia is of utmost importance.  
• Early detection of ischaemia is very important in order to avoid irreversible ischaemia.  
• If the patient is in shock, the risk of limb ischaemia is greater.  
• Small and preterm babies are at greater risk for ischaemia.    
• No fluid or medication other than heparinized saline can be given through arterial line.  This mistake 
can occur if the line is not properly labelled, or even wrongly labelled and presumed to be a venous 
line. Complications and Pitfalls
Precautions
Treatment of digital or limb ischaemia (prevention is the priority) This is difficult

within 24 hours after insertion, to reduce 
infection risk.
• Emergency access for IV fluids and medications when other methods of vascular access have failed.
• In time-critical circumstances, e.g. decompensated shock with severe vasoconstriction or cardiac 
arrest, IO access may be the INITIAL means of vascular access.
• Fractures, crush injuries near the access site or a proximal ipsilateral bone. IO itself can cause 
fractures especially in young infants. 
• Conditions in which the bone is fragile e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta.
• Previous attempts to establish access in the same bone.
• Infection over the overlying tissues.
• Prosthesis or orthopaedic procedure near the insertion site.
• Sterile dressing set.
• EZ-IO drill set if available (Insert according to manufacturer guidance).

1. Immobilize the lower limb.
2. Support the limb with linen.
3. Clean and drape the area, and administer local anaesthetic at the insertion site (in conscious 
patients).
4. Insert the IO needle aseptically, at 90° to the skin, 1-3 cm below and medial to the tibial tuberosity 
(over the flat part of the tibia).
5. Push through the skin until bone is felt. 
6. Avoid the growth plate, and advance the needle at a 90° angle with a rotational motion, until a 
‘give’ is felt. 
7. Remove the trocar while stabilizing the needle cannula.  
8. Aspirate bone marrow with a 5cc syringe to confirm access. Failure to aspirate does not mean the 
insertion has failed, and placement can also be confirmed by flushing fluids without difficulty or 
signs of extravasation. 
9. Infuse a small amount of saline and observe for swelling at the insertion   site or posterior to the 
insertion site. Fluid should flow in easily and no swelling must be seen. (Swelling indicates that the 
needle has penetrated through the posterior cortical bone, and must be removed).
10. Connect the cannula to tubing and IV fluids. Secure with a dressing.   
11. Monitor closely for any extravasation of fluids.

• Bleeding from accidental disconnection and open connection.
• Embolisation of blood clot or air in the infusion system.
• Vasospasm or thrombosis of aorta, iliac, femoral or obturator artery leading to limb or buttock 
ischaemia. 
• Thrombosis of renal artery (hypertension, haematuria, renal failure), mesenteric artery (gut 
ischaemia, necrotising enterocolitis).
• Vascular perforation of umbilical arteries, haematoma and retrograde arterial bleeding.
• Nosocomial infection.Complications3. Hold the stump gently (not taut) and cut the umbilicus horizontally leaving behind a 1 cm stump. If 
you pull the stump taut before cutting, you will end up with the arteries protruding 2 mm beyond 
the umbilicus jelly and this make successful cannulation more difficult.
There are 2 arteries and 1 vein. The artery is smaller in diameter, white and constricted. Hold the 
stump upright with your fingers or artery forceps. Gentle and patiently dilate the lumen of the 
artery with a probe.
Insert the catheter to the desired distance.
4. Ensure the successful and correct cannulation of one umbilical artery.
• Tips for successful catheterisation of the umbilical artery:
• In a fresh and untwisted umbilical stump, the two arteries can be clearly distinguished from 
the vein.
• Stand to the left side of the baby if you are right-handed and direct the catheter posteriorly 
and inferiorly in the direction of the lower limbs.
• The blood withdrawn is bright red.
• Visible arterial pulsations can be seen in the column of blood withdrawn into the catheter. 
However, this pulsation may not be seen in very preterm babies and babies in shock, using 
the closed system.
• In accidental cannulation  of the umbilical vein, the catheter tip can be in the left atrium (via the 
foramen ovale from the right atrium into left atrium) or in the left ventricle giving a backflow of 
oxygenated blood.
• Stick the label of the catheter onto patient’s folder for future reference (brand and material of 
catheter) in the event of limb ischaemia or thrombosis of femoral artery occurring later.
5.  Observe for signs of arterial ischaemia to the lower limbs and buttocks (colour, cold skin, capillary 
refill delayed, poor dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses) during and after the procedure due 
to arterial vasospasm. An assistant lifts slightly the edge of the drape without compromising the 
sterility field to inspect the lower limbs circulation.
6. If there are no complications (limb ischaemia – see pitfalls), secure the UAC to avoid accidental 
dislodgement.
7. Perform a chest and abdominal X-ray to ascertain the placement of UAC tip
• Between T 6-9 vertebra (high position)  - preferred
• At the L 3-4 vertebra  (low position)
Withdraw (do not push in, to maintain sterility) the catheter to the correct position, if necessary.
8. Monitor the lower limbs and buttock area for ischaemic changes 2-4 hourly
9. Infuse heparinised saline continuously through the UAC at 0.5 to 1 U/hr to reduce the risk of 
catheter occlusion and thrombotic events.
10. Note the catheter length markings every day and compare with the initial length ( to check for 
catheter migration).
11. Remove the UAC as soon as no longer required to reduce the incidence of thrombus formation and 
long line sepsis.

and sited at the 4 and 8 o’clock positions. However, in a partially dried umbilical cord, the 
distinction between the vein and arteries may not be obvious.
• The venous flow back is sluggish and without pulsation (in contrast to the arterial pulsation 
of UAC).
• The blood is dark red in colour.
• Stand to the right of the baby (if you are right handed).
• Tilt the umbilical stump inferiorly at an angle of 45 degrees from the abdomen. Advance the 
catheter superiorly and posteriorly towards the direction of the right atrium.
• Measurement of Central venous pressure 
• The UVC tip is sited in the upper IVC (inferior vena cava).

• The routes of central venous access include peripherally inserted central catheter - PICC (e.g. 
through cubital fossa vein into SVC) and femoral, external / internal jugular and subclavian veins.  
• These lines must be inserted by trained senior doctors in selected seriously ill children requiring 
resuscitation and emergency treatment. 
• The benefits of central venous access must be weighed against the numerous potential 
complications arising from the procedure.  
• This includes pneumothorax and life-threatening injuries of the airway, lungs, great vessels and 
heart.  
• The Seldinger technique of central line insertion applies to all sites and the femoral vein cannulation 
technique is described.  
• Ultrasound-guided insertion may be used, when available, to increase the success rate and 
decrease complications. (refer APLS 7th Ed).   
• Seriously ill ventilated paediatrics patient especially with difficult peripheral vein access.
• To monitor central venous pressure.
• Longer term intravenous access (compared to IO access).
• Haemodialysis.Indications4.5 CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS: FEMORAL VEIN CANNULATION IN

5th Edition For Malaysian HospitalsSection 22       PRACTICAL PROCEDURES• Absence of trained doctors for this procedure.
• Bleeding and clotting disorders.
• Risk of contamination of the cannulation site by urine and faeces for femoral vein cannulation. 
• Sterile set.
• Lidocaine (Lignocaine) 1% for local anaesthetic, 2 mL syringe, 23 G needle.
• 5 mL syringe and normal saline, paediatric infusion set and 3-way tap.
• Seldinger cannulation set – syringe, needle, guide wire, catheter.
• Sterile dressing.
• Do not lose or kink the guide wire (inserted too deep into patient).
• Do not fracture the guide wire with the needle.
• Take care not to accidentally cannulate the femoral artery (blood pressure could be low in a patient 
with shock and mistaken for the femoral vein).
• Beware of local haematoma at insertion site.
• Always check the distal perfusion of the leg and toes before and after procedure.Contraindications
Equipment
Pitfalls1. In a ventilated child, give a dose of analgesia (e.g. Morphine / Fentanyl) and sedation (e.g. 
Midazolam).
2. In the supine position, expose the chosen leg and groin in a slightly abducted position. Elevate the 
hips slightly.
3. Identify the landmark by palpating the femoral artery pulse in the mid-inguinal region. The femoral 
vein is medial to the femoral artery, 5-6 mm in infants, 10-15 mm in adolescents. Ultrasound 
guidance is recommended for this procedure, when available.     
4. Clean and drape the inguinal region.
5. Infiltrate local anaesthetic at the insertion site.  
6. Insert the saline filled syringe and needle at a 45o angle to the skin and parallel to the femoral artery 
pulsation. The needle enters the skin 2-3 cm below the inguinal ligament, and the vein 1-2 cm 
below the inguinal ligament. Aspirate gently and advance needle in-line with the leg.  
7. When there is a backflow of blood into the syringe, stop advancing, and disconnect the syringe from 
the needle.  The guide wire is then promptly and gently inserted through the needle, and into the 
vein.  
8. Withdraw the needle gently and carefully without risking damage to the   guide wire including 
kinking (will lead to difficulty or inability to remove   guide wire after catheter insertion) and 
fracturing the guide wire.  
9. Insert the dilator over the wire into the vein, then remove dilator and insert the catheter over the 
wire. Take care to avoid displacement of the wire either into the patient or out of the vein.
10. Make sure the end of the wire is sticking out of the catheter, before inserting the catheter into the 
vein. 
11. Once the cannula has been inserted, remove the guide wire and draw blood from all the lumina, 
flush immediately and lock the catheter. 
12. Suture the catheter in place. Attach the infusion tubing, and tape the tubing securely in place. Procedure

Procedure
1. Give sedation (e.g. Midazolam), apply local anaesthetic (e.g. EMLA).
2. Take a random blood sugar sample (RBS) after lumbar puncture.
3. Place child in lateral recumbent position with neck, body, hips and knees flexed. Monitor oxygen 
saturation continuously.
4. Visualise a vertical line between the highest point of both iliac crests and its transection with the 
midline of the spine (at level between vertebrae L 3-4).
5. Clean area using standard aseptic techniques: povidone-iodine and 70% alcohol.  
6. Gently puncture skin with spinal needle at the identified mark and point towards the umbilicus.  
The entry point is distal to the palpated spinous process L4.  
7. Gently advance a few millimetres at a time until there is a backflow of CSF (there may be a ‘give’ on 
entering the dura mater before the CSF backflow). Collect the CSF in the designated bottles.
8. Gently withdraw needle, spray with op-site, cover with gauze and bandage.
9. Ensure that the child lies supine for the next 4 to 6 hours, continue monitoring child till he or she

• Malposition.
• Bronchopulmonary fistula
• Vascular injury
• Intrathoracic or Intraabdominal organ injury
• Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (clamp for 1 hour after draining 10ml/kg pleural fluid, to reduce 
risk).1. Sedate the child.
2. Position the child with ipsilateral arm fully abducted.
3. Clean and drape the skin.
4. Infiltrate local anaesthetic into the skin at 4th or 5th intercostal space on the mid-axillary  line.  
“Triangle of safety” – anterior to mid-axillary line, posterior to  pectoral groove and above 5th 
Intercostal space.
5. Check approximate length of the chest tube to be inserted as it follows  the curve of the chest.  Tip 
of the chest tube should be sited at the  highest point of the thorax (for pneumothorax) and lowest 
dependent   part of the thorax (for pleural effusion). 
6. Open Insertion Method
• The open method (without the metal introducer) of chest tube cannulation is the preferred 
method. The closed method (with the introducer) is dangerous and NOT recommended. 
• Make a small incision in the skin just above the 5th rib.  Use the blunt dissecting forceps to 
dissect through the subcutaneous tissue and puncture the parietal pleura with the tip of the 
clamped forceps. Put a sterile gloved finger into the incision and clear the path into the pleura. 
This may be difficult in a small child. Advance the chest drain tube into the pleural space during 
expiration. 
• For drainage of air, roll the child slightly to the opposite side for easier manoeuvring and 
advancement of the chest tube anteriorly.  Place the tip of the chest tube at the incision.  Point 
the catheter tip anteriorly and superiorly, and slowly advance the chest tube.  
• For drainage of empyema, maintain the child in the supine position, direct the catheter tip 
posteriorly and inferiorly, and proceed with the rest of the procedure.
• Connect the chest tube to underwater seal.
• The water should bubble (if pneumothorax present) and the fluid column fluctuates with 
respiration if chest tube is in the pleural space.
• Secure the chest tube with sutures in children or sterile tape strips in neonates.
• Connect the underwater seal to low-pressure continuous suction (negative pressure usually -10 
to -20 mmHg) if necessary for empyema.
• Confirm the chest tube position with a chest X-ray.

• Leakage of ascitic fluid (typically when Z-track not performed properly)
• Hypotension if excessive amount is removed quickly
• Abdominal wall hematoma or bleeding
This procedure is like abdominal paracentesis. However, dialysate  or normal saline needs to be infused 
into the peritoneum through a small catheter to ‘float’ the intestines (create an ascites) before insertion 
of peritoneal dialysis catheter.5.4.3   PERITONEAL DIALYSISComplications
(See Chapter on Acute Dialysis )4. Aspirate while advancing the catheter until fluid is seen in the syringe. Remove the needle and 
reconnect the catheter to the syringe and aspirate the amount required. Use a three-way tap if 
large amounts need to be removed.
5. Once complete, remove the catheter (if paracentesis is for diagnostic purpose). Cover puncture site 
with sterile dry gauze.

ComplicationsPreparation for Micturating cystourethogram (MCUG)
• Trimethoprim 4 mg/kg BD for 3 days (one day before, on the day of  and one day after the procedure) 
should be given as periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis. (Adjust to 2 mg/kg BD for 3 days if eGFR < 
15ml/min/1.73m2)
• If oral medication is not feasible, alternative such as IV/IM Gentamicin may be given before the 
procedure. 
• IV/IM Cefuroxime/Ceftriaxone should be considered in children with kidney impairment and dose 
adjusted appropriately
NOTE: 
The catheter should be inserted until urine drains out and not more than 7cm in young boys and 5cm in 
young girls.   
• Important to ensure that the length of the catheter introduced is appropriate to avoid knotting of the 
catheter in the bladder

obtain urine specimen. It may be difficult to obtain  a urine sample but if successful, the urine is not 
contaminated by perineal bacteria and will indicate a true positive urinary tract infection.
1. Make sure bladder is palpable. Give a drink to patient half to 1 hour before procedure.
2. Position the child in supine position. Clean and drape the lower abdomen. Topical anaesthesia is 
optional in paediatric as it is considered to cause as much pain as aspiration procedure itself.
3. It is encouraged to use ultrasound to increase success rate. On ultrasound, the bladder appears 
anechoic with posterior enhancement.
4. Insert the needle attached to a 5cc syringe perpendicular or slightly caudally to the skin, 1 cm above 
the midline of the pubic symphysis.
5. Aspirate while advancing the needle till urine is obtained. Ideally the needle is visualized entering 
the bladder with ultrasound guidance.
